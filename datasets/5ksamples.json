Now's your chance to catch up on his sordid past with these compilations from his club recordings of the '70s and '80s. He loves the shaggy dog story and the wicked song but doesn't mind flinging one-liners either. His raucous, scatological, profane humor is best enjoyed by heavy drinkers familiar with the Scottish tongue. The rest of us will get plenty of yuks from those punch lines we can decipher.

{"asin": "0001053396", "description": "Writing poetry has always been a way to express what is going on in the world around us. Unfortunately, sometimes what is around us is war. Acclaimed British actor Paul McGann reads poems that date from the eighteenth century to modern times in this moving audio anthology. McGann is originally from Liverpool, and he still retains a slight Northern accent. Its lilting cadence blends well with the rhythm and worldliness of these powerful poems. Although some of the pieces are well known, others are less so, and this makes the collection even more intriguing for lovers of literature.

Terry Jones, former member of Monty Python and a medieval scholar to boot, sounds perfectly comfortable with the rhythms and language.

First she tackled the  unfortunate Scott expedition to the South Pole inThe Birthday Boys; later (but emphatically pre-DiCaprio) came the sinking of the Titanic, inEvery Man for Himself. Now, in her 3rd historical novel (and her 16th overall), she takes on the Crimean War, and the result is a slim, gripping volume with all of the doomed intensity of the Light Brigade's charge--but, thankfully, without the Tennysonian bombast. \"Some pictures,\" a character confides, \"would only cause alarm to ordinary folk.\" There's a warning concealed here, and one that easily disturbed readers would do well to heed:Master Georgieis intense, disturbing, revelatory--and not always pretty to look at.Bainbridge's narrative circles round the enigmatic figure of George Hardy, a surgeon, amateur photographer, alcoholic, and repressed homosexual who counters the dissipation of his prosperous Liverpool life by heading for the Crimean Peninsula in 1854. His journey and subsequent tour of duty are told in three very different voices: Myrtle, an orphan whose lifelong loyalty to her \"Master Georgie\" becomes an overriding obsession; Pompey Jones, street urchin, fire-eater, photographer, and George's sometime lover; and Dr. Potter, George's scholarly brother-in-law, whose retreat from the war's carnage and into books takes on a tinge of madness.United by a sudden death in a Liverpool brothel in 1846, these characters plumb the curious workings of love, war, class, and fate. In between, Bainbridge frames an unforgettable series oftableaux morts: a dying soldier, one lens of his glasses \"fractured into a spider's web\"; a decapitated leg, toes \"poking through the shreds of a cavalry boot\"; two dead men \"on their knees, facing one another, propped up by the pat-a-cake thrust of their hands.\" Glimpsed as if sidewise and then passed over in language that is as understated as it is lovely, these are images that sear into the brain.Master Georgieis full of such moments, horrors painted with an exquisite brush.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Master Georgie", "price": 16.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 14149327}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZSC6TKS3L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0349116156", "0307947726", "0786702079", "0786701463", "0786707739", "B001IDZK0I", "0226743497", "0786703229", "0802142818", "0375700234", "0679731369", "0812976533", "0385722109", "1609450868", "1416562605", "B000GH2YRY", "0679777504", "1590170180", "B001LF2H7W", "0374526400", "0807608815", "1573225436", "1609450566", "B003H4RCJS", "1586420046", "0143124870", "0571319661", "0385474547", "0140092552", "0316074314"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0349116156", "1609450868", "0307947726", "B008SM8T5K"]}},

Irina sees the old rocking horse in a junkstore window and decides she must have it. The proprietor, sensing her need for it, gives Bella to her, and tells her about a live Bella, a beautiful, once-wild horse that used to belong to a local farmer who mistreated her. As the wooden horse gradually comes to life, Irina blossoms. She is happier than she has ever been, especially when her Bella takes her on thrilling midnight rides. One cold winter night, the animal leaves the child to run through the hills with a herd of wild horses. Irina is devastated. Too late she realizes she has not heeded the storekeeper's warning \"Never say that any creature on this earth is yours....\" She withdraws into herself again-until Bella returns, bringing her injured foal for Irina to nurse. This time she promises herself to let it go when it is grown. In so doing, she frees herself to grow up. The message may seem obvious to some, but that will not deter young horse lovers and beginning readers of fantasy, who will be absorbed by the details of equistrian care, the magic of the animal's transformation, and the excitement of the late-night rides. The many fine black-and-white drawings convey Irina's sadness, Bella's magical changes, and the strong energy of the galloping horses.Virginia Golodetz, St. Michael's College, Winooski, VTCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Enchanted Horse", "price": 8.09, "salesRank": {"Books": 13835337}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

The book opens as the Little Princess screams, \"I want my dinner!\" The picture of her red-faced temper tantrum, complete with silverware flying through the air, shows more than the text reveals. Next, she demands her potty (while squeezing toothpaste all over the cat). Finally, she remembers to say the magic word when she requests her teddy bear. Then, on a walk, she encounters a big, red-nosed blue Beastie. He pitches a fit about wanting his dinner, and the Little Princess tells him to say please. The smiling, yellow-crowned child reminds him to say thank you, too. The simple text combined with exuberant, colorful watercolors show Ross at his best. Any child who has been reminded to be courteous will appreciate the cheerful, comical illustrations.?Janet M.

{"asin": "0001845357", "description": "Great granddaughter to Charles Dickens, Monica (1915-1992) was born into an upper middle class family. Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out - she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain. No More Meadows, which she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC  - she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children. After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England where she continued to write until her death aged 77.", "title": "Ballad of Favour", "price": 6.15, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XjAqAfhcL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 9410457}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0001473123", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, \"\"Prophetic Truth,\"\" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.\"--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Book of Revelation", "price": 2.96, "salesRank": {"Books": 1344709}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317G8R2TYBL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0001472933", "1614271046", "0310308909", "1169770673", "1603864830", "B000GGTK2M", "160386489X", "B000872ZB2", "B000ALVEHM", "1169723578", "0963584529", "1614270074", "B0094V8OXG", "0962880914", "1579106323", "0324222882", "0687413559", "0830825916", "084231251X", "0664240224", "083412257X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1614271046", "160386489X", "1596053003", "1603864830"]}},

{"asin": "0002007649", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Widely known in Canada from hisMontreal Gazettecolumn, and work with the Discovery Channel, Schwarcz (Let Them Eat Flax) is an entertaining guide through the tangle of conflicting research studies, advertising claims, special interest groups, age-old myths and popular opinion that make diet a cloudy subject. In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0002153238", "description": "A glossy, predictable paean to American Jewry by the producers of the Day in the Life series, this oversize collection of photographs traverses the country, capturing cowboys and Soviet Jewry activists, magicians and roving rabbis. The belabored point here is that Jews have special customs--circumcision, bar mitzvah, Passover seder--that set them apart, but Jews are also as American as apple pie. Hence, many of the 197 pictures, most of them color, reiterate that Jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of Jewish doctors, astronauts, hikers, soldiers, prisoners, casket-makers, emotionally disturbed youth. Cohen, co-editor of Christmas in America , plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of Steven Spielberg and his mom, Leah Adler, who owns a kosher L.A. restaurant, combines the two themes). A picture of the Jewish attorneys of a Century City law firm smacks of ghettoization and one of a woman immersing herself in a Brooklyn ritual bath is intrusive.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Jews in America", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UjvUE2HDL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001KKBALC", "0231108419"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 2208619}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0002007681", "description": "Grade 7&#8211;10&#8212;San Francisco Soames has never had a \"normal\" family. He and his siblings are named after places, his twin sisters are always getting into trouble, and his parents are former hippies. But things take a turn for the worse in their small Vermont town when his parents inform him that his father is gay. A homophobic bullying incident outside a pharmacy, in which the store's owner attempts to protect Cisco with a shotgun, turns ugly and the next thing Cisco knows, he's responsible for putting Mr. Patterson in a coma. In an attempt to give their son a fresh start, the boy's parents send him to his Uncle Vincent's ranch in middle-of-nowhere British Columbia, but Cisco's fate doesn't immediately improve upon landing on Canadian soil. He appreciates cooking and eating good food, but his uncle's moose stew is barely edible. Belgue excels at capturing the realities of small-town life. Likewise, details of the Canadian wilderness will make readers feel transported to the great white North. Unfortunately, the story suffers from uneven pacing and characters who never quite come to life. While Cisco's cooking aspirations could draw an audience, they are not a large enough part of the story and fail to carry it. Given the dearth of YA fiction featuring gay parents, this title is significant.

{"asin": "0002154129", "description": "Though at first glance too luscious for the pots, pans and grease stains of the kitchen, this opulently illustrated oversize volume--travel book as much as recipe collection--can function there admirably, seducing the hungry and the restless. The latest in the publisher's series of regional cookbooks (others on Italy, China and Asia have preceded it), it will keep readers turning pages even if they never pick up a saucepan. Chapters alternate between discussing the different regions of France and offering a good selection of traditional recipes. French-born authors and cooks Marianne Comolli, Elisabeth Scotto and Michele Carles reflect on the history and geography of France with appetizers from Provence, entrees from Lyonnais and desserts from Anjou. This is hearty, not haute , cuisine: well-organized recipes are scaled for the average cook, who won't have to go in search of rare ingredients or spend hours chopping and mincing. Les soeurs Scotto make use of blenders and food processors when needed.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "France: The Beautiful Cookbook- Authentic Recipes from the Regions of France", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ED0F88FXL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0002550326", "0002553708", "0002551543", "000215854X", "0681152710", "0002550296", "0002551519", "0067575986", "0002154463", "B000ELJ3R6", "0002553481", "0002553724", "0002159317", "0681152672", "0895351854", "0002250357", "000215949X", "0681152699", "0002551152", "0002250535", "0067576001", "0681152788", "0681152680", "0067575951", "0067575870", "0067575897", "0067575862", "0681152664", "0681047976", "076457602X", "0743253345", "0060580313", "0895352109", "0811846466", "0067575900", "158234180X", "0743249941", "B00A7KUYNQ", "0868672505", "000255464X", "0061373265", "0307236722", "0060580283", "0002159996", "006757596X", "0688028470", "0060893133", "0517692201", "1564582922", "B000ESSRNU", "0067575978", "039458404X", "0067575943"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0002551543", "0002553708", "0002550326", "0002250535"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 754658}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

The photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. From a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on Main Street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. Many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of Mongolian nomads to a Tantric Buddhist monastery in occupied Tibet. The photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at Beijing University as students began to occupy Tiananmen Square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed.

{"asin": "0002159643", "description": "A marginally educated seducer and drunk who died at 37 in 1796 remains Scotland's premier poet and songsmith. McIntyre's bicentenary biography (his last was a life of BBC founder John Reith, The Expense of Glory) is unsparing about Burns and his uneven output, from haunting lyrics to bawdy songs. Carlyle, so McIntyre writes, saw Burns's career as \"a tragedy of potential unfulfilled and opportunity squandered.\" Rather, McIntyre contends, there was scant opportunity in hardscrabble Ayrshire in Burns's time, and the flavor of that bleak life as it was actually lived is vividly evoked, as are the poet's self-defeating imprudences of every sort. Having little schooling, Burns pragmatically described his working methods as \"Untill I am compleat master of a tune, in my own singing... I can never compose for it.\" His practice was not that of the university, but it produced \"Flow gently, sweet Afton\" and \"The Cotter's Saturday Night.\" He also produced more children, illegitimate and legal, than he could afford, and left his plough for a meager salary as excise tax inspector that kept him on horseback and away from home, from the contemplative time for writing and from exploiting usefully his flair for friendship with admiring men and adoring women in circles above his class. His lyrical gift had pushed him out of the milieu that moved him to verse. As McIntyre observes, Burns's local literary reputation, once spread, \"had both made and undone him.\" He had \"an extraordinary blindness to where his own interest lay.\" Although he was \"never the slave of time,\" that became another of his many failings. McIntyre's careful scrutiny of Burns is exemplified by his quoting an exculpatory letter ostensibly done in haste. \"Pardon this confused scrawl,\" Burns explains. \"?Indeed I know not well what I have written.\" But, McIntyre notes, \"That was not strictly true?he had taken time to try his hand at a draft.\" Illustrated.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Dirt &amp; Deity: A Life of Robert Burns", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BYY9Z96AL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0691141711"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 3040520}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

He was born in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to British diplomatic parents who were friends of Emperor Haile Selassie. Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

{"asin": "0002173808", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Like the similar books about Australia, Hawaii, and Japan, each of these offers multiple photographic impressions recorded on a single day. Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images. Both recommended for their candid presentation of ordinary daily life.

{"asin": "0002159511", "description": "On one day in May 1991 more than 75 distinguished photographers undertook to capture on film the many sides of Ireland and its people. As with previous Day in the Life explorations of other countries, the photographs provide a stunning panorama of everyday life in a variety of settings, from pastoral to urban, from working-class neighborhoods to country estates. Celebrating the land and its citizens, these 200 mainly color photographs are accompanied by maps indicating the location of each and by concise captions. Subjects include a Benedictine nun on a monastery farm, a man soaking in his bath at a spa, a covey of \"punk rockers\" in a Dublin neighborhood, the bishop of Cork putting \"a little body Irish\" on a road bowling match. A feast for the eyes is the result of an impressively coordinated project that, though ambitious, makes no claim as a definitive record of a complex country. 90,000 first printing; major ad/promo; first serial to Islands magazine.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "A Day in the Life of Ireland", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91DN8ntjpwL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0002179695", "0002157292", "0002551195", "0002175800", "000217734X", "0002179679", "0002173808", "0002153211", "000255481X", "0971802106", "0002151677", "0894807609", "0002251043", "0002151626", "0959424407", "0789499754", "0871564378", "B001H31NHS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["000217734X", "0002179695", "0002551195", "0883633396"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 935971}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Many had participated in A Day in the Life of Canada ( LJ 11/1/85) and the similar books on Australia and Hawaii. This, however, is the first such coverage of a non-Western, non-English-speaking country. The color photographs are sumptuously reproduced and every one holds our attention. The pictures are arranged chronologically, from early morning until late at night. A map of Japan shows where each was taken. Photographers are credited next to their pictures, and biographies of participants follow the picture essay, as does a story about their experiences taking these 300 pictures, chosen from some 135,000 exposures. The range of subjects covered is enormous and shakes up our notions about Japan. Highly recommended.

Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text.

Newly revised and updated, this indispensable history of social libertarian thought now reaches into the 21st century&mdash;touching upon themes echoed in other recent titles, including Raj Patel'sThe Value of Nothing. Marshall casts a wide net, gathering all traces of antiauthoritarian socialist thought in works from Lao Tzu through Noam Chomsky, social ecology, and the Zapatistas. Readers will be repeatedly rewarded by Marshall's judiciousness and close readings of both the great names in anarchist history&mdash;Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Tolstoy&mdash;and less expected contributors&mdash;Rousseau, Swift, and Burke. Blowing away cobwebs of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, this is a stimulating portrait of a highly varied but distinctive political ideal, tradition, and practice arising from the enduring human impulse to be free.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He left school aged fourteen and worked for a number of years in the aircraft industry before embarking on an adventure - travelling to South Africa by road and supporting himself along the way by working in gold and asbestos mines. Bagley spent the Fifties in South Africa, working as a freelance journalist and critic, before moving to Italy with his wife, Margaret, and then to Guernsey. His first novel, The Golden Keel, was based on a true story overheard by Bagley in a bar in Johannesburg, about Mussolini's vast personal riches and the men who went looking for it. It was published in 1963 to great acclaim and followed by a further fifteen popular adventure ovels. Bgley's career spanned two decades and his influence can be seen in the work of several highly respected thriller writers. When he died, in 1983, his final novel, Juggernaut, was completed by his wife.--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Snow Tiger", "price": 14.08, "salesRank": {"Books": 4560181}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2%2BuTXIfL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1842320165", "1842320114", "1842320149", "0745140335", "B002X4PXRQ", "1842320505", "184232019X", "0385149115", "1842320122", "0194216683", "0006157556", "0002215837", "0312001657", "0007304811"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007304781", "0007304811"]}},

By becoming unhappily entrapped in a railroad tunnel during an air raid, and then by moving carefully across hundreds of miles of French countryside behind German lines all the way to Calais.

Barrett adeptly represents the English, Canadian and Anglicized French and German accents of the all-male military cast of characters. His skillful reading heightens the tension of this World War II thriller and keeps the listener anxious to hear what happens next, rooting for Bert throughout the tale.  J.D.N.

{"asin": "0002237245", "description": "Few American novels can approach the power and impact of this extraordinary work, a fictionalized autobiography by the Chinese author of Half of Man Is Woman . A harrowing account of the effects of repressive government on the individual, the novel moves between China and San Francisco, New York and Paris as its protagonist examines his own \"old-fashioned patriotism\" during a trip to the West. Central to the character's psyche are the wounds left by his attempted \"reformation\" by the Communists, a process which at one point involves his being marched to the execution ground--and left alive while those around him are killed, to wait for the rest of his life for the bullet to find him. The scene on the execution ground is unforgettable, its shocking subject filtered through a careful and farseeing irony. Although the level of the writing is generally sophisticated, the prose is occasionally self-conscious or strained--but this failing in no way impinges on the book's greatest accomplishment, its inherent refutation of its own dire assessment of China today: \"A country that cannot produce a nobility of the spirit is a country that is doomed.\"Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Getting Used to Dying", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NI1KOJptL._SL500_.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 7025163}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

The stories' themes and characters are often fanciful, sometimes verging on the bizarre--the survivor of a freakish crime, as in \"Oh, Marley,\" or a man who runs off with his daughter's teenage friend in \"Evangeline's Mother\"--but in Kinsella's hands they become poignantly credible. Profiling a wife's long-buried resentments as reflected in her \"Driving Patterns,\" the author expertly sets a menacing mood. Narrated by the gunfighter's mild-mannered friend, \"Billy in Trinidad\" shows a sympathetic side of Billy the Kid.

British spymaster Tweed thinks one of his four European section chiefs is a double agent and possibly a sadistic mass murderer. Tweed treks to Germany, where one of his top agents was killed, obviously betrayed by the traitor. The Russians and East Germans, hoping to kill Tweed, lead him to Lubeck, home of mysterious philanthropist Dr. Berlin. Deliberately using himself as bait to flush the two-faced \"Janus,\" Tweed is saved from assassination in Lubeck only with the help of British agent Bob Newman. Eventually Tweed uncovers a Russian plotfostered by a tough-talking Gorbachevto flood England with heroin, which the Soviets assume will destroy the country. The interminable comings and goings of Tweed and Newman, one in England, the other in East Germany, are chronicled in clumsy prose, often like a bad translation (\"She moved agilely but with grace.\") and unintentionally funny \"Cunning as a fox, Markus Wolf.\"). The unlikely plot and pat solution are matched only by Tweed's phlegmatic dialogue: \"We can't afford the scandal. England can't. Mass murderer a senior chief in the SIS.

{"asin": "0002258579", "description": "Fusing historical legend, mad scientists and shocking performance art, Scottish writer Wallace (The Pied Piper's Poison) has crafted an unsettling tale of menace set during Edinburgh's Fringe Festival. In the early 1800s, expositional scientist Dr. Alexander Brodie is busy developing a heinous device that extracts and preserves the souls of unsuspecting victims (many dug up from graves) for future use in experiments on other patients. Fast-forward to 1999, where this same device turns up being tested in public at showman Peter Dexter's \"Resurrectionist Expression\" performance, much to the horror of young Charles Kidd, Dexter's public relations guru. Dexter's shadowy display of \"studied theatrics\" quickly backfires when the crowd angrily overtakes the stage after several audience members lose consciousness and vanish. Running parallel is an eerie, captivating transcribed interview with Daniel Lowes, who attends Dexter's resurrectionist festival performance. He describes dizzying, nightlong heavy drug use, sex, mystery and graveyard antics, which, joined with the other dangling plot pieces, concludes with a surprisingly cohesive explosion. Not all of the narrative sparkles. Wallace scatters dull legal briefs , which contribute little more than a different font style. He has a vivid imagination, and his story intermingles the curious history of Edinburgh's underbelly of grave robbers and medical mischief with some present-day grotesqueries, but the many scattered subplots limit the potential for a truly chilling experience.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Resurrection Club", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZS9NS098L.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 13909208}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0002251833", "description": "\"It seems beyond the comprehension of people that someone can be born to draw comic strips,but I think I was,\" said Charles M. Schulz, creator ofPEANUTS. \"My ambition from earliest memory was to produce a daily comic strip.\" And that was exactly what Schulz did everyday sincePEANUTSdebuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950.Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 26, 1922, Schulz was nicknamed \"Sparky\" after Barney Google's horse \"Sparkplug.\" He began his fascination with comic strips early, reading the Sunday comics from four different newspapers with his father each week. With encouragement from his father, a barber, and his mother, Schulz enrolled in a correspondence course in cartooning at what is now the Art Instruction School, Inc. in Minneapolis.His career in cartooning was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the Army and soon embarked for Europe in the fight against Germany. Upon his return, Schulz landed his first job in cartooning atTimeless Topix, a Catholic comic magazine. Soon after, he took on a second job as a teacher at Art Instruction, where he worked with Charlie Brown, Linus and Frieda, who later lent their names to thePEANUTScomic strip.Schulz's first break came in 1947 when he sold a cartoon feature called \"Li'l Folks\" to theSt. Paul Pioneer Press.\"Li'l Folks\" ran as a weekly feature for two years. In 1948 he sold a cartoon panel to the Saturday Evening Post and would go on to sell 15 more panels between 1948-50.In 1950, after many mailbox rejections, Schulz boarded a train from St. Paul to New York with a handful of drawings for a meeting with United Feature Syndicate. On October 2 of that year, PEANUTS, named by the syndicate, debuted in seven newspapers. When asked if he thought the strip would be a success, Schulz replied, \"Sure, I thought it would last; in fact, when I started out I thought, 'I'll be drawing this for the rest of my life.'\"Almost 50 years later,PEANUTSappears in over 2,600 newspapers worldwide and Charles M. Schulz has become a household name. The strip has maintained its universal appeal throughout five distinctly different decades. \"As a youngster, I didn't realize how manyCharlie Brownsthere were in the world,\" said Schulz. \"I thought I was the only one. Now I realize thatCharlie Brown'sgoofs are familiar to everybody, adults and children alike.\"Schulz would work six weeks ahead on daily and Sunday strips and, unlike many cartoonists, drew every comic strip without the assistance of an art staff. He also wrote all the scripts and storyboards for thePEANUTStelevision specials, earning him five Emmy and two Peabody Awards, and was involved in all aspects of thePEANUTSpublishing and licensing programs through United Media Licensing in New York. His company, Creative Associates, was formed in 1970 to handle his business affairs and assist in maintaining the high qualitystandards associated withPEANUTS.Obviously, even after producing almost 18,000 comic strips, Schulz remained dedicated toPEANUTS. When questioned about the overwhelming devotion to his work, Schulz explained, \"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.\" Among other numerous honors, Schulz received two Reuben Awards from the National Cartoonists Society (Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Humor Strip) and was inducted into the Cartoonist Hall of Fame.Although the strip remained his first love, Schulz was an avid sports enthusiast with a long-time passion for golf (he regularly participated in the Pro Am at Pebble Beach, California). He also enjoyed tennis. Above all, he loved ice-skating and the game of hockey, and was the only non-hockey professional to be presented the coveted Lester Patrick Award for his contributions to the game.

Although his girlfriend  is pregnant, he's got no major personal problems--until the day he  rolls into a small town called Furnace, where a middle-aged woman  pushes a baby carriage straight into his wheels and then vanishes. The  dead baby's teenage mother and other passers-by swear the wind caused  the carriage to roll, and the police take Josh for a troublemaker when  he insists on writing a statement to the contrary. Shaken, Josh hits  the road again, only to find that it's not so easy to get away from  Furnace; something inhuman is hot on his heels. A pretty hitchhiker  recognizes a mysterious scrap of writing in his truck as ancient runes  spelling out--on human skin--a horrific curse. From then on, all roads lead back  to Furnace as Josh races to unscramble a weird puzzle involving a  wealthy town councilor, the Philosopher's Stone, and a demon who will  destroy Josh in three days unless he returns the runes to their  rightful place.The rotating point of view can be confusing, and the language (Gray is Scottish) occasionally doesn't ring true to an American ear.

As symbols of fertility, they are present in mythology  worldwide, from the creation myths of Tibet, China, Korea and India in  the East to the classical myth of the birth of Venus in the West. They  have long been the subject of popular sea ballads and chanties, and  have inspired works of music, literature and art by many a brilliant  soul, including Franz Joseph Haydn, Oscar Wilde, T.S.

A subject of feminist history and women's studies, mermaids  have been represented in popular culture in many forms: advertising,  music videos and successful Hollywood films.This lavish gift book,  replete with many special features, including vellum pages, metallic  ink, an enchanting gatefold, a fortune-telling mermaid and a mermaid  tattoo, is a tactile, enticing trip under the sea. Author Theodore  Gachot discusses the archetypal appeal and multifaceted symbolism of  the mermaid -- as goddess, heroine, fertility symbol and ocean spirit  -- throughout time and across cultures.

Likewise, few readers will be tempted by the second installment's ludicrous intrigue involving the Chinese government's attempts to find and kidnap the newly reincarnated, British-born Dalai Lama. A former political adviser to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, Dobbs seems to have gone soft since New Labour took power, if Goodfellowe's soap-operatic midlife crisis is an indicator. With his wife hospitalized for depression, his teenage daughter hiding family planning and pregnancy leaflets and his junior ministerial career over, Goodfellowe is totally unprepared to be enlisted by Buddhist monks in the search for the next Dalai Lama. Dobbs delivers plenty of international cat-and-mouse episodes, stretching from London's Chinatown to Tibet, along with scenes of Chinese human rights abuses that would alarm Amnesty International, but none of this adds up to much of a read. Although there are good guys to cheer for and baddies to boo in the race to find the special child in England's Tibetan refugee community, this featherweight entertainment has no punch.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Buddha of Brewer Street", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 2247179}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519XD1TCWWL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1492606677", "1492606642", "1492606618", "0006477100", "0061099775", "1471111512"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1492606677", "1492606642", "1492606618", "1847393241"]}},

It is more than just a pretty book to set on the coffee table; this is a book cooks will enjoy and one that makes good reading if you are planning a trip to Italy.Fred Plotkin's text covers the history, economy, and particular ingredients important in each of Italy's culinary regions. He also explains how changes in the way Italians live are affecting how they eat. Meals, for example, now follow the traditional structure less rigidly in most parts of the country, with the southern areas holding closest to the old ways. Also, while cooking in Italy is still remarkably regional, people are enjoying recipes less tied to their locality. Use of fresh and local ingredients, however, remains strong.The recipes are by Lorenza De' Medici, who also did the food forItaly, the Beautiful CookbookandTuscany, the Beautiful Cookbook. Here she offers 220 dishes. Some show how Italians are modifying classics; others illustrate the living quality of Italian cooking in its acceptance of new ingredients and in new ways of using familiar ones. Perfect examples of this are Eggplant with Yogurt and Mint and Rice Salad with Pesto.

{"asin": "0002250756", "description": "Sporting arresting covers, a snappy layout with handsome, glossy photographs and a neat conceit, this series of four slender volumes offers considerably less in the way of practical information. McDonald, garden editor of Houston Life, provides beautiful pictures of blooms, foliage and fruits, accompanied by brief sections of text written in an authoritative, somewhat off-putting prose that tends toward hyperbole: \"Roses have set the standard for redness from the beginning of recorded history.\" In each volume, the color range is quite broad, so that Red embraces the \"rose-purple spikes\" of the obedience plant and the yellow-orange brilliance of the Gloriosa daisy, while the silver foliage of dusty miller is included in Blue. Unquestionably pretty to look through-the photos were taken mainly at nurseries and public and private gardens in the U.S., Canada and England-and likely to spark ideas in a gardener's mind, the volumes nevertheless disappoint by scanting such crucial considerations as appropriate planting zones (the flowers featured tend to favor hot climates) and other plant-specific requirements. Each volume includes a packet of containing three or four varieties of color-selected seeds, enough for a 1'35' \"border\" (i.e., two windowboxes). Gardeners seeking an in-depth discussion of color theory, sample garden designs and a plant gallery will need to look farther than this series of gift books.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Color Garden (Red : Single Color Plantings for Dramatic Landscapes)", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hvoWlEkqL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 11073973}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0002326876", "description": "Murder will out, and does, in this latest addition (after 2000's An Enigmatic Disappearance) to the long-running and well-loved Inspector Alvarez series. Set as usual on Jeffries's home island of Mallorca, it features fair-play detection and (more importantly) keen observation of the human species. When the body of a retired Bolivian diplomat is found floating facedown in his swimming pool, Alvarez suspects the death was no accident. When he begins receiving calls threatening his life if he doesn't drop the case, he knows he's on the right trail. Then the unexpected occurs, proving family bonds are stronger than bureaucratic torpor. The simpatico Alvarez bases his conclusions not on fantastic deductions or painstaking forensic evidence but on patient and profound insight into the human soul. Like Maigret, he savors a case, displaying tolerant bemusement at human foibles. (\"Why did modern youth enjoy hairstyles which made them look as if they were suffering from alopecia?\") In addition, there are nice touches of local color throughout. (\"The bay backed by mountains and marshland, the cerulean sea, and the curving beaches of sand, pebbles, or rock, were still beautiful despite the marina, flats, restaurants and stores selling kitschy goods and the holiday camp which looked as if it had been designed by a French bureaucrat.\") In sum, the style is pleasing, the detection inspired and the novel, as a whole, sometimes tragic but never dispiriting.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Ambiguity of Murder (Inspector Alvarez Novel)", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7MPPYNXL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 10959482}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Only the Bible and works by Shakespeare have outdistanced her. Problems at Pollensa Bay & Other Stories provides a delightful addition to this vast body of writing by \"the mistress of mystery.\" Though these eight stories are not new, several are less well known, and this audiobook represents an exciting renewal of one of the world's most popular authors. \"The Harlequin Tea Set,\" thought to be Dame Agatha's last short story, is a tale of mistaken identity and features Mr. Saterthwaite and Harley Quin, who also appear together in \"The Love Detectives,\" a little-known story about a messy love triangle. Mr. Parker Pyne, Christie's goverment statistician turned detective, is called upon to save a love-struck young man in the title story.

Both Soviets and Americans race to recover the sub, which is carrying a revolutionary new superconductor, iriniump. 65 . This novel offers plenty of action, but the writing is unintentionally funny. It's hard to believe that an author could put these words into a character's mouth: \"I used to walk five miles to school in weather like this. . . . Used to say it was colder than a witch's left tit. Damned if I ever knew why the right one was warmer.\" Or this, when a polar bear approaches a female CIA agent on the ice cap: \"With a sinking feeling, Justine realized she was not alone.\" The characters are stereotypes straight from central casting, including the absent-minded professor, the evil Soviet sub commander and the beautiful female spy. Davis even manages to include two lovemaking scenes, which severely strain the credibility of his story. One of these scenes takes place in an empty torpedo tube while the father of the woman guards the couple's privacy.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Raise the Red Dawn", "price": 11.04, "related": {"also_viewed": ["0312169280", "0553294628", "055326205X", "0671769049"]}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0002552264", "description": "Waldrone ( Cold Spaghetti at Midnight ) here finds redeeming value in a humble thing, traipsing with the potato through culinary Mexico, France, Italy, Hungary, the Middle East and various quarters of North America. As glimpsed through the fine nostalgic mist of Jones's camera, the root swells a Mediterranean fish stew; stuffs golden fowl or green chilies; or lies au naturel , pending baking or roasting. Among the most appealing recipes are the simplest: in roasted balsamic potatoes and onions, recommended as an accompaniment to red meats, the contenders are oven-roasted first in olive oil and then in seasoned balsamic vinegar; in rosemary potato skewers, potato chunks are boiled, dredged in herbs and spices, and grilled on charcoal. But if the potato lends itself to these visceral pleasures, it can also sneak into upper-crust tarts without suffering. (And even into hummus--where, one suspects, it may languish.) Waldron, trained at La Varenne, offers appetizers, side dishes and main courses in her brief book, a new entry in Collins's attractive Country Garden Cookbook series, and even offers advice to the amateur grower--but omits desserts, where potatoes can give depth and moist substance, if not pungence, to tortes.

Turner, a folklorist and lead singer in an all-women rock band, asserts that Madonna has invaded the psyches of women as a symbol of fearlessness, sexuality free of shame, and self-realization. The women whose dreams she records include homemakers, teenagers, grandmothers, a professor and a banker. Some dream of rescuing Madonna from danger; others dream of making love to her; in one dream the pop star is a policewoman. To most of the dreamers, Madonna is a sisterly companion or empowering friend. The collages, in a surreal style highly reminiscent of rock 'n' roll album cover art, reinforce the overhyped notion of Madonna's \"liberating sexual self-centeredness.\" 35,000 first printing.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "I Dream of Madonna: Women's Dreams of the Goddess of Pop", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61INrxMCCaL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1593764294", "1576874818"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0312117825"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 2174646}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

You'll feel more than that after browsing through this nostalgia-soaked photo-biography.

Only a few short years later, Leonard had become Roy Rogers, \"King of the Cowboys,\" and was launched on a career that would encompass 81 movies, a TV series, and hundreds of radio performances and recordings. The success of Roy Rogers says a lot about the U.S. during the Depression and throughout World War II, but it says even more about the wide eyes of kids everywhere at anytime.

The protagonist, Hong, is a high-ranking policeman whose stubborn honesty leads him to investigate, unofficially and at growing personal risk, the mysterious death of his friend and mentor, while at the same time he is officially tailing a visiting American psychiatrist presumed to be a spy. Hong's investigations take him on a journey through the past that ends with his expose of treachery and crime among Mao's closest associates, the \"tigers\" of the Revolution. The novel's chief strengths are its intensely realistic depiction of a Peking bureaucracy, wherein those with the strongest noses for \"spiritual pollution\" appear to be the most corrupt, and Hong himself, a sympathetic and credible figure caught in the toils of sordid events. Its weaknesses are a pedestrian style and characterization that, Hong aside, is somewhat lacking in depth and vibrancy. Nathan wrote Rising Higher and Amusement Park.

Like the forerunners in the series, this one is scaled oversize to accommodate not only color photographs of avocado pasta and tomatillo soup, but also of the local landscapes, such as a Native American powwow and New Mexico's San Juan mountains. As such, Southwest can be read as a gastronomic travel book, filled with escapist textures and tastes. The book is organized by locale (e.g., the Rio Grande Basin gets one chapter) and by genre (desserts and beverages; soups, stews and chilis). It's both picturesque and practical: Kolpas sets the scene well for upscale-indigenous meals with his surveys of Southwest history and habits, while Fenzl offers practical and appealing recipes (especially for salsas and the like, and for appetizers). So while the book looks glamorous, it is also useful.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Southwest: The Beautiful Cookbook", "price": 23.3, "salesRank": {"Books": 586718}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WRG0VDQJL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ELJ3R6", "000215854X", "0002159317", "0002250357", "0002551519", "0002553724", "0002550326", "0002154463", "0002551543", "0681152710", "0002553708", "0002154129", "0873588827", "0002550296", "000215949X", "0681152699", "0895351854", "0681152672", "0002551152", "0067575986", "0002250535", "0681047968", "0067576001", "0067575870", "0912333707", "000255464X", "0681152788", "0681047976", "0067575862", "0688109411", "0681152680", "1558321039", "0060580313", "0811802930", "0868672505", "0067575951", "0067575897", "1607745046", "1423604709", "0873588568", "0067575943", "0781813042", "0725408014", "1887896783", "0060580283", "006757596X", "B000ESSRNU", "0307351416", "0067575935", "0517692201", "1607742675", "0307383253", "1607743167", "1579652395", "1607740354", "0895352109", "0067575927", "0002159996", "0067575900"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0002551543", "0002250357", "0873588827", "0002159317"]}},

{"asin": "0002553708", "description": "Recipe collection, travelogue, history lesson and art book, the 13th of the publisher's Beautiful Cookbooks may be the most ambitious, and is surely among the most accomplished of the series. IACP and James Beard Foundation Award-winner Goldstein (Back to Square One; Festive Occasions) has exercised masterful selection skills to balance this sampling of 250 recipes from a region that supports a wealth of culinary traditions, including southern Italian, Provencal France and coastal Spain; Turkey, the Middle East and northern Africa; Greece and the Balkans. Food scholar Ayla Aygar's comprehensive essay on the culinary and geo-political history of the Mediterranean region introduces the seven chapters, which are organized around courses and types of dishes, and feature recipes from each culinary tradition. Interspersed among chapters are shorter essays discussing the culinary heritage of each region. The recipes, which generally suggest variations found in other countries (and are an etymologist's delight), are uncomplicated, gracefully written, accessible to the American home cook and highlight the area's abundance of vegetables and fish. Of particular note are the chapters on soups and fish, ranging from the simplicity of Turkish grilled swordfish to Sicilian stuffed squid, and including four variations on a Moroccan fish marinade. With 250 photographs, this volume is also a feast for the eye.

Author Kenneth Pople has utilized the wealth of information about his subject to produceStanley Spencer: A Biography, a scrupulously researched examination of the complicated artist. Though Spencer's art had fallen out of favor in the years following his death,Stanley, the award-winning play based on his life, has renewed public interest in the man and his work, making Pople's biography timely, indeed.Stanley Spenceris divided into 47 chapters, each one concentrating on a specific painting, through which Pople attempts to illuminate a particular period of the artist's life.  He is especially strong at analyzing the work itself, but less so at breathing life into the people who surrounded Spencer: his family, wives, mistresses, and friends.

All but one of the deceptively short pieces were originally published in Saturday Night magazine and have as their subject matter quite commonplace objects and activities of everyday life. Visser's forte is to take the ordinary and turn it into the extraordinary by providing a cultural history of its evolution (each piece has a bibliography). The practice of showering, for example, was considered dangerous and became habitual only in the last 40 years, after central heating. Until the 1900s, when they established themselves as \"professionals,\" doctors and lawyers accepted tips in the same manner that waiters and hairdressers do today. The concept of paid vacations has its roots in 1920s fascist Italy, where workers were ordered to take time off to exercise their bodies.

{"asin": "0002558572", "description": "This affectionate, almost loving portrait of two of Britain's most distinguished and controversial artists is made all the more poignant by the fact that the biographer, art journalist and author Daniel Farson, died while writing it. Being about Gilbert & George, the salacious material is fairly unorthodox--the most shocking revelation is that George married as a young man and has two children--and for the most part Farson is almost apologetic about any intrusion into Proesch and Passmore's (their surnames) private lives. The first half of the book takes us from their childhoods in the Dolomites and Tiverton via their meeting at St. Martin's School of Art in the late 1960s to their current status as art icons. The second half sees Farson following them around--Moscow, Shanghai, Barnstable--as they exhibit around the world. Farson wisely highlights his admiration at the outset, and the reader is clear that this is no hatchet job. That said, he covers both the art and the lives with a straightforward professionalism that is never less than absorbing. This book is a fine tribute to Gilbert & George; equally, their closing words are a fine tribute to Farson: \"On 27 November our dear Daniel died, not knowing how much we loved him (though we told him often enough).\"--Nick Wroe", "title": "Gilbert and George: A Portrait", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJCC0EM9L.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 5322796}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Dirk meets beautiful Eva Rojas, a World Health Organization team member inspecting a mysterious epidemic that has struck in the Sahara, when he interrupts an attempt on her life. Then the National Underwater and Marine Agency sends Pitt and Giordino up the Niger on a gunboat to find the source of a toxin that causes red tide organisms to reproduce out of control, threatening to poison the oceans and deplete the earth's oxygen supply. The pairalso in next sentence is captured by evil billionaire Yves Massarde and Mali's tyrannical despot Gen. Kazim, but they escape to find the source of the pollution at Fort Foreau, Massarde's desert toxic waste factory that receives--but doesn't dispose of--nuclear and chemical wastes. Recaptured, Pitt and Giordino are sent to Kazim's desert slave camp, where they find Eva and her team--marked for death. A deadly trek across the Sahara is their only hope. Cussler champions ecological issues with verve, and continues his love affair with history by tossing in a Confederate ironside stranded in the Sahara near the remains of an aviatrix lost during the '30s. Some judicious cutting might have improved the narrative, but it's great fun nonetheless, putting Beau Geste swashbucklers against the vilest of villains.

{"asin": "000255934X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This is a lively if superficial overview of the lives and times of Princess Diana's illustrious family through 500 years, from the Tudor age to the present. Gaining and losing vast fortunes; making shrewd, status-enhancing marriages; and jockeying for social and political power are the recurring themes of this family saga, whose subjects rose from being wealthy farmers during the reign of Henry VII to ranking among the most prosperous and prominent families in the land by the 18th century, only to see both their wealth and their status decline throughout the Victorian and contemporary eras--until Diana, third daughter of the eighth earl, made her \"fairy-tale\" marriage into the royal family. Including such notables as Sarah Churchill and the infamous 18th-century duchess of Marlborough, whose carefully calculated scheming made the family one of the richest in the land, the Spencer clan is replete with colorful characters. That Princess Diana herself drew strength from this ancestral heritage, as Pearson claims, is undoubtable; more dubious, however, are his repeated assertions that various facets of Diana's own character are direct inheritances from one ancestor or another. This suggestion that biology is destiny culminates in the proposition--based on the observation that Princes William and Harry look more like their mother than their father--that the Spencer genes have superseded those of the Windsors and will be instrumental in shaping the future of the British monarchy. While this claim that the Spencer family history yields vital insights into the destinies of Diana and her children seems somewhat overstated, those who admire the late princess of Wales and those who are drawn to accounts of English dynastic history will find the story of the Spencers engrossing.

Both are celebrated inProvence the Beautiful Cookbook, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book authorRichard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift.Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven&#xE7;al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made.

And its great merit is to remind us that at the centre of all the dynastic wrangling, political conspiracy and media speculation stands a man who has often felt very alone.' The Economist'FOR more than 40 years a veil has been drawn over one of the most tragic episodes in the life of King Juan Carlos of Spain. Just before Easter 1956, his brother, Alfonso, 14, was shot dead with a .22 calibre pistol while the 18-year-old Juan Carlos was alone with him. The king's authorised biography made no mention of the incident. But light has been shed on it by Paul Preston, a professor at the LSE, whose biography laying bare the king's private life has reached No 1 in the Spanish bestseller lists. Preston's book has caused a furore by suggesting the future monarch may have pulled the trigger. It says he admitted to a friend he had been holding the gun at the time. The professor has given more than 60 interviews to the Spanish media and has been bombarded with hate mail and death threats.' Sunday Times, 11 May 2003'The lights and shadows of the life of Juan Carlos are reproduced with scientific precision. Preston's scalpel has been implacable... A lucid, penetrating, accurate book, backed up with an arsenal of facts... A scientifically admirable work that once more sees one of the great European historians flexing his muscles.' Luis Maria Anson, La Razon'A splendid book which, as an unauthorised biography, offers both a panoramic view of contemporary Spain as well as providing profound insight into the role of a King in the late twentieth century... The book provides a magnificent mosaic to solve the riddle that is the Spain of the last seventy-five years.' Marius Carol, La Vanguardia'Preston's Juan Carlos is much more ambitious than a mere biography. I must confess that it is a long time since I read a six-hundred page book at a sitting. This is one of the books that, after thirty pages, you just know that you either stop or let yourself be carried on right to the end.

Artist Money (Anna Pavlova, 1982) stumbled into dance photography in the early 1960s after seeing the first televised performance of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. For the next several years he accompanied the dancers on tour and, against the constant objections of the two photo-phobes, managed to record them together in rehearsal and onstage. Many of the black-and-white images included here have never been published before, and they afford both a charmingly informal glimpse of the two artists and a record of the emotional power and style that made them sellouts at the box office. Most of the photos are maddeningly uncaptioned, but one picture of Fonteyn doing her tendus in a stone archway in Athens seems innocuous enough until one reads in the accompanying text that a workman had just missed bashing her head in with a beam. In the same series, we see Fonteyn stitching a toe shoe while Nureyev looks on; the young dancer had just announced that he would not dance that night. ``Perhaps we'd better just give the money back?'' Fonteyn replied calmly, stitching away. Unfortunately, we get few such intimate anecdotes and no real understanding of their working relationship. Fonteyn was an aging star, whom the Royal Ballet management was ready to shunt aside, Money tells us. Nureyev was a fiery young dancer, a recent defector from the Soviet Union. He renewed Fonteyn's career, even dared her, according to the author, to surpass herself. The magic of that interaction is missing from Money's text. But it is very present in his photos: Fonteyn's remarkably youthful Aurora exults in the arms of Nureyev, her Prince; as Romeo and Juliet they evince innocent love tragically betrayed. Both Fonteyn and Nureyev outdanced the usual span of a dancer's career; both died too young. Money's photos and sketches remind us of the way they were. --Copyright &copy;1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Two days after the funeral of her husband, Frank, Ellie feels immobilized by grief. Then the respectable Mrs. Dawes rushes to Ellie's door to announce she's just discovered the body of a young man at the church altar. Ellie soon becomes involved in the mystery surrounding the victim's murder, the subsequent disappearance of his mother and the disturbing quarrels of the young couple next door. Simultaneously, she examines her own life and, with a new confidence and strength, is able to stand up to Frank's bullying aunt Drusilla and her own spoiled daughter, Diana. Life without Frank will not be as predictable and safe, but it will certainly be more exciting. Heley's keen observations and insights into her characters create a rich atmosphere of the social life in an English town where, as reflected in the inviting pastoral jacket illustration, folk work in the local charity shop, go to the greengrocers and stop for sausages and mash at the Sunflowers caf . Combining sparkling wit and humor (particularly regarding Ellie's first attempts to master the computer), quirky acts of fate and a dramatic ending, Heley provides all one needs for a satisfying read, except perhaps a cozy chair, a cup of tea and some chocolate biscuits.

Set in Europe during various historical periods, the beautifully cadenced tales depict moments of insight or deep emotion, illuminated with unusual clarity. In \"The White Door,\" she imagines the last, bitter days of Mozart, unable to finish his Requiem or communicate with his gay and talkative wife, even to play the card games he adores. Alone, and in the final dark, he laughs aloud. Less poignant, but equally brilliant in detail, is the title story, in which an art dealer, obsessed with beauty, takes an arduous journey from Scheveningen to Copenhagen to sell to a Danish nobleman the Vermeer painting he cherishes almost as much as money. After both men die, the nobleman's daughter offers to return the painting to the merchant's son, who has inherited only his father's interest in matters financial. Like \"The Death of Ivan Ilich,\" the last of these stories, \"Order in the House,\" records the terrible struggle of a man, paralyzed by a stroke, to reenter life. Slowly his eyes begin to flicker with understanding, as spring brightens his window. But his wife, sho sits at his bedside awaiting the collapse of the useless body, never looks into his eyes.

The celebrated Belgian sleuth visits the sleepy English village of Warmsley Vale to check into the background of Gordon Cloade, supposedly a victim of the London Blitz. He had wed an attractive young widow, the former Mrs. Underhay, now the sole possessor of the Cloade family fortune. The deceased's sister-in-law told Poirot that \"spirits\" informed her that the widow's first husband is still among the living, raising suspicions about Cloade's demise. Fraser's tone at once reassures listeners that, just as on television, they are in capable hands.

Sickert's notorious sexual escapades run the gamut from romantic to pragmatic to farcical. Profoundly inspired by James McNeil Whistler and Degas, Sickert became a leader among radical British painters, an influential art critic, and a teacher. Sturgis' glowing portrait stands in stark opposition to crime writer Patricia Cornwell's extravagant claim inPortrait of a Killer(2002) that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Indeed, Sturgis makes short work of Cornwell's allegations after fully substantiating his portrait of Sickert as a revered artist whose joie de vivre, \"rare power of objective vision,\" frankness, and intensity revitalized the British figurative tradition.Donna SeamanCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Drawing for Beginners is a straightforward manual on the essentials of pencil and pens, charcoal, pastel, pen and wash, and conte. The usual animals, birds, people, landscapes, and buildings are covered. The strength of the book is its gathering of several contributing artists and the resulting broad variety of styles and techniques. Sketching presumes a certain level of skill and builds from there. Graphite and charcoal sketching are quickly superseded by the sophisticated color and movement available from oil pastel, aquarelle pencils, and watercolor wash.

{"asin": "0004140850", "description": "Long neglected, antique roses with their extravagantly blowzy flowers, quite unlike the tight-petaled blooms of their modern cousins, hybrid teas, are deservedly enjoying renewed popularity. These two titles by British rosarians are evidence of this trend. Scarman, owner of an English nursery that specializes in old-fashioned varieties, presents a beautifully illustrated directory of 150 roses as well as chapters on plant design, companion planting (with examples of innovative combinations), and basic care. Although Beales, a commercial rose grower and daughter of renowned old-rose specialist Peter Beales, intended her Rose Basics as a general guide to growing all types of roses, she features many heirloom roses worthy of cultivation. Particularly useful is the chapter on roses for difficult conditions, such as shade and poor soil; such information is often neglected in basic rose culture guides. Because both of these titles were written for a British audience, they lack specific critical advice for American gardeners, i.e., appropriate rose selection and care for the highly diverse climatic regions of the United States. For such information, readers should turn to Rayford Reddell's A Year in the Life of a Rose: A Guide to Growing Roses from Coast to Coast (LJ 11/15/96) or Judith McKeon's Encyclopedia of Roses: An Organic Guide to Growing America's Favorite Flower (LJ 9/1/95).

{"asin": "0002713810", "description": "Veering from absurdist farce to social satire, this dazzlingly inventive, entertaining novel from Swedish author Lindgren (Light) plays relentlessly upon the theme of authenticity and artifice, illusion and reality. After picture framer/art dealer Theodor Marklund buys at auction The Madonna with the Dagger, this high-priced symbolic canvas, painted in 1919, is confiscated by tax officials. But then a shady art collector known only as \"Goatee\" returns the painting?or a forgery?to Markland. Others lay claim to The Madonna, including the son of the woman who posed for it, and Marklund's greedy ex-girlfriend. As Marklund's life spins into in a web of falsehood and deception, a similar fate befalls his friend Paula, a pop-music superstar who is having an affair with her plastic surgeon. Nothing is what it appears to be?not The Madonna itself, nor Marklund's artificial hand, nor the presumed suicide of Paula's manager, whom she may have pushed out the window. Loaded with scattershot allusions to Heidegger, Dali, Madonna, Baudelaire, Bach, Schopenhauer and Barbara Cartland, this post-Pop fable spoofs the mass media's fabrication of reality as it ponders the abyss between modern art and life.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "In Praise of Truth: The Personal Account of Theodore Marklund, Picture-Framer", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/813zwGuF7NL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 6131883}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Carbonetti had a surprise hit with her first book, The Tao of Watercolor. This one may also find a wide audience, despite its rather superficial use of Zen. It is a bold attempt, but those seriously interested in Eastern religion as artistic inspiration will be disappointed. Howard is a master of light in both watercolor and oil. Appointed Official Artist in Northern Ireland and a member of the Royal Academy, he is a stimulating teacher with strong views. Going from the sublime to the hideous, Jefferies's book on fantasy art will either stimulate the imagination or provoke nightmares.

Colin Mudford, an Australian boy, suspects that his parents favor his younger brother, Luke. When Luke collapses suddenly and is hospitalized, Colin wistfully imagines he has a malady of his own. Yet upon hearing that Luke will die of cancer, Colin sets out to find a doctor to cure him. Sent to live with relatives in England, Colin first tries soliciting the Queen's help, then approaches hospital physicians. He eventually meets Ted, a homosexual whose lover is dying of AIDS. Colin and Ted support one another through a difficult time (including Ted's assault by homophobic thugs), which enables Colin to shed his self-centered ways and allow a brave, resourceful and loving person to emerge. Gleitzman's liberal sprinkling of humor prevents the novel from becoming too dark. While the progression is slow at first, and several Australian expressions (\"sooky,\" \"sticky-beaking\") may perplex readers, the material's topicality makes this a special book.

{"asin": "0004140648", "description": "In this instructively focused tour of Chatto's celebrated gardens in Essex, England, the author demonstrates her guiding principles. Chatto's vision of gardening is defined by two influences: plant ecology (\"Plants have their preferences\") and Japanese garden design (\"Surprise elements are necessary; shock tactics are not\"). Chatto's passion is the play of shape, line and textureAwhich color may or may not enhance. But even more important is the garden's ecology of soil, light and air. After years of tracing garden plants back to their parents in the wild, Chatto knows the preferred growing conditions for individual species of perennials. This knowledge orders her gardens into habitats and her book into chapters: \"The Entrance Garden,\" \"The Water Garden,\" \"The Open Walks,\" \"The Shade Garden,\" \"The Dry Garden.\" Amid what seems a crowd of plants, each chapter spotlights one or two of Chatto's favorites, such as hellebores, waterside grasses, ferns, euphorbias and fritillarias. This feature, along with a plant guide at the end of the book (where useful lists of companion plants join individual plant profiles), accompanies the lush, abundant photographs. A welcome reprise of the 1989 British title, this revision will suit American gardens in zones 4-7.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Beth Chatto's Green Tapestry: Perennial Plants for Your Garden", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61C2D93H7WL.jpg", "related": {"buy_after_viewing": ["0671670360"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 215944}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

A member of the Society of Architectural Illustrators, Taylor has created a sumptuous work, rich in detailed images, and, moreover, complete with a brilliant text.

{"asin": "0004709977", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The greatest arms race in history began in the first years of  the 20th century as World Powers expanded their fleets. Germany  challenged the Royal Navy's global dominance, the U.S. and Japan  established themselves as major naval powers. The revolutionaryHMS  Dreadnoughtwas succeeded by even larger and more powerful warships  that clashed spectacularly at the battle of Jutland in 1916. Plans for  a new generation of &#39;super dreadnoughts&#39; were delayed by  international treaties, but Japanese ambitions eventually led to a new  arms race with the U.S.. This naval race produced the world&#39;s  largest and most heavily-armed battleships, like theYamotoandOwa. Combat experience in World War II soon revealed that  submarines and aircraft posed a lethal threat to even the greatest  battleship. Only the U.S. Navy had the resources to maintain a  battleship force after 1945, and these mighty warships have attached  enemy coasts from Vietnam and the Lebanon to the 1991 Gulf War.Acclaimed naval illustrator Tony Gibbons has painted all classes of  twentieth century battleship forJane&#39;s Battleships of the 20th  Century. Every major battleship is shown in profile, with the 25  greatest battleships illustrated across the full width of the page,  with accompanying plan and bow views.Naval historian Bernard  Ireland reveals the fascinating background to each class of battleship.  Each entry includes comprehensive technical data. Special features  investigate what happened when battleships opened fire: Why British  battle cruisers were so vulnerable to German shellfire, how American  radar helpedUSS Washingtonsink theKirishimanoff  Guadalcanal and when was theBismarckdoomed to die.", "title": "Jane's Battleships of the 20th Century", "price": 24.41, "salesRank": {"Books": 834596}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QFS4PEGL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0517378108", "0517679639", "1909160601", "0785829997", "0007105584", "1571452621", "1851703780", "0517234513", "0004720652", "0890096236", "1780192924", "0517679647", "158663044X", "1607101092", "B00IWULSTC", "0754820920", "B000MY628S", "0870217186", "1591146879", "1591143365", "1591146852", "0883653001", "0004721438", "1844763897", "089009084X", "0004708229", "184832085X", "0710609833", "8361220755", "2913903495", "836287807X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0517679639", "0517378108", "1909160601", "1780192924"]}},

The book first looks at how white mercenaries came to play a key role in the struggle for the Congo in the 1960s, and how the end of the war in Vietnam coincided with the start of the war in Rhodesia, attracting a new generation of mercenary soldiers. The story moves on from the Angolan debacle of 1976, to a succession of operations in Africa and South America, and on to the Balkan conflict.

{"asin": "0004724542", "description": "Operating under the premise that the World Wars I and II were actually parts of the same huge conflict, 38 historians have written 33 chapters comparing the two wars. There are chapters on occupation and genocide, war in the air and undersea, POWs, casualties, and the experience of killing. The chapters on the national and military leadership (e.g., Churchill and Lloyd George, Hitler and the Kaiser) offer the most direct comparisons. The biggest difference, of course, was the relatively stable (but incredibly deadly) trench warfare of 1914-18, unlike the 1939-45 period, which was notable for its immense geographic scope, the number of troops involved, and mobile operations (land, air, and sea). The aim of this book is \"to demonstrate the diversity of personal experience in the two world wars,\" primarily in the uniformed services. The next volume will cover the national experiences of countries and the role of civilians. There is no bibliography, but notes are found at the end of the chapters. There is a glaring lack of maps, which would have been helpful. Suitable for the military history collections of both public and academic libraries. Daniel K.

Fiercely self-abnegating (as she has been all along in America bringing up Nicole with only the help of a nightclub entertainer lover), Anna vanishes altogether, leaving Nicole to be appropriated by her British relatives, presented at court, pursued by many young men including the son of her mother's first husband, until she turns her back on wealth and position to marry a young man who takes her to Boston, dies in WW II, while Anna at least finds happiness with a Russian from her childhood. At the end Nicole returns to Lynmara as its countess and to an old age as strong-minded as her mother's. . . . A long soft read for several successive evenings.

{"asin": "0006165699", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "What pleasurable admiration one derives from the fact that in an age, and an area, where most writers become burnt-out cases, Eric Ambler - who after his classic beginnings and less remarkable middle years and books - is now getting better and best. Burnt-out cases is a deliberately chosen term since this new novel takes place in Graham Greene-land - one of those desolate little Central American coffee republics where even the palm trees are \"like tired, untidy women.\" Here Dr. Frigo (which means frozen meat) assumes an uncommitted, spectator stance after the assassination of his father (was he a real liberator or just an opportunist?) twelve years before, ignoring his mother's treason theory and her desire to have Ernesto (his given name) as an avenger. But he just goes about his doctoring and has an affair with one of the most charming creatures met in a long time - Elizabeth, an artist, also a Hapsburg of direct descent six times removed from the Empress Maria-Theresa of Austria, Elizabeth who makes unsettling insinuations and only too direct historical referrals to the Hapsburg past which might be pertinent now. Particularly since Ernesto is asked, forcibly, to attend Villegas, his father's successor and candidate for a new takeover backed by international off-shore oil interests. But apparently there is something very wrong with his patient, more than his \"abdominal inconveniences\" - there's his slurred speech which when finally diagnosed makes the whole matter one of the greatest confidentiality. And Ernesto is obliged to continue at the failing arm's length of his patient all through the grand deception, the chaotic coup (even if a fait accompli before it was started) and assassination. Thus we have a parapolitical thriller in which Ambler is only too aware of the pragmatic complexity of a submerged part of the world where the returns are great for a few - but then no \"government can do things for people without doing things to them.\" Ambler's entertainment - and surely it is more than that - is urbane, amusing, cautionary and threateningly urgent at all times - in a word, masterful.

She develops an obsessive hatred for Damien Adair, the physician she holds responsible for both tragedies. She tries to forget by taking up a nursing career, eventually going to the Crimea. There, working beside Dr. Adair, she finds herself attracted to him despite her hatred. The ending is predictable. This is one of the better Holt novels, with a well-drawn historical background. Susanna does not always make sense, but she is a strong and loving woman whose friendships ignore class boundaries. Literary Guild main selection. Marylaine Block, St. Ambrose Coll.

The catalyst is the arrest of a British agent, James Curwen (aka Jeez Carew), in Johannesburg. After Jeez is sentenced to hang, along with four young blacks, he is effectively abandoned by the politically wary English government. Service with the secret intelligence agency had taken Jeez from his wife and baby son, Jack, 24 years earlier. Now Jack learns belatedly of his father's fate and flies from London determined to rescue the doomed man. In Pretoria, Jack meets a white anti-apartheid teenager and his sister, who provide the explosives that Jack sets off at the prisonthe climax to this unremittingly sustained drama.

{"asin": "000616174X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The classic 1959 Christie tale is revisited in this utterly charming and intriguing murder mystery in which two teachers find the body of the new games' mistress in the gymnasium, the latest victim of the so-called cat killer. Though not a predominant character for most of the tale, Christie's legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. Hugh Fraser relates this tale with classic English charm, speaking with a pitch-perfect and ear-pleasing dialect that adds to the atmosphere.

Graham Stanton's essay puts this claim to the test. In 1994, German biblical scholar Carsten Thiede announced that one of the oldest surviving fragments of a gospel (held in Britain) was even older than had previously been claimed. He stated that it was contemporaneous with Christ, an eye-witness account rather than a second-century retrospective. The Times picked up the story and Thiede has published his thesis under the title The Jesus Papyrus (Weidenfeld and Nicholson).

Lewis. He wrote for the man on the street, seeking to bring Christian truth and questions of religious, business and political ethics to a wider audience. Now a new generation is rediscovering Chesterton through the recent revival of interest in ethical issues. There is also a campaign to canonize Chesterton, launched in 1995 and endorsed by such senior figures as Cardinal Emmet Carter of Toronto.

Nyala, a former British colony newly rich with oil, hopes to prop up its shaky democracy and economy with a new power station near its oil fields.

It provides an empirical and a conceptual basis for the idea of relational spirituality, an understanding that is not only of great practical interest to teachers, clergy and parents, but creates the groundwork for a prophetic protest against forces in the modern world that would undermine the natural spirituality of human beings. It is not only refreshingly clear in an area often somewhat confused, but offers original insights into the lives and attitudes of young children.' - John M Hull is Professor of Practical Theology in the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education in Birmingham and Emeritus Professor of Religious Education at the University of Birmingham, England. 'The Spirit of the Child...is currently the seminal book on children's spirituality on the international scene.' - Christian Education Journal 'Very, very impressive.' - Professor Andrew Greeley, University of Chicago [One of best known sociologists of religion in the world, with a US nationally syndicated newspaper column on religion.] 'For many people, this was a ground-breaking research study...many, perhaps most, subsequent research studies made use of their definitions of spirituality and the broad perspective of spirituality that encompasses all children everywhere.' - Professor Don Ratcliff, Toccoa Falls College 'David Hay and Rebecca Nye have done outstanding research in this difficult, yet most important area. Almost all children are born with a spiritual potential, but how are we to recognize its specificity in a given case and how to foster its development - rather than to let it wither away or even corrupt it unwittingly? Reading this volume will help all involved to understand these issues more deeply, and to contribute more to the blossoming of a child's spirituality.' - Professor K. Helmut Reich, School of Consciousness Studies and Sacred Values, Rutherford University 'It is difficult not to be beguiled by Hay's analysis. What might be called its seamless holisticity, its concern to wed the spiritual to practical and altruistic purpose, and its lack of religious dogmatism (despite Hay's professed Roman Catholic affiliation) provide a sophisticated argument for educational and social purposiveness.' - Clive Erricker, Editor, International Journal of Children's Spirituality 'I have just re-read The Spirit of the Child after seven years. It was recently used in a course I taught at General Theological Seminary in New York City. The book is still as fresh and exciting today as it was seven years ago. You cannot ask for a better team of writers to produce such a volume. I have admired David Hay's work since his days at the Alister Hardy Research Centre at Manchester College, Oxford and his wonderful book, Exploring Inner Space. Dr. Hay is a biologist and experienced researcher in this field as well as an insightful commentator who sets the stage for the research described in The Spirit of the Child. He also contributes to the research, and then follows up with some practices that might be used to help children develop spiritually. Dr. Nye, a child psychologist attached to The Divinity School at Cambridge University, is a gifted and insightful researcher with an informed ability and deep intuition for knowing and being with children. As with Piaget, Winnicott and a handful of others the children knew they could talk to Dr. Nye and that they would be understood a --John M Hull is Professor of Practical Theology in the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education in Birmingham'Today I find references to The Spirit of the Child in many different fields, including education theory, human development, psychology and sociology.

Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like.  In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow.  Now newly designed for a fresh audience, Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years. With a proven track record, it continues to speak to the needs and aspirations of people today. It is best included in self help sections of general bookshops, but also has a religious appeal.", "title": "Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am?", "price": 8.96, "salesRank": {"Books": 117594}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uqqYwoYbL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0451165225", "0883473224", "1559242833", "0883473240", "0883473216", "0883472996", "0895050293", "0553348000", "091359203X", "0883473003", "0883473437", "0894864025", "0553268147", "157324466X", "0892560029", "0913592471", "0913592617", "0671762273", "0894866370", "1558744274", "0894865838", "1592854702", "156838985X", "1439102147", "006091646X", "1573242136", "0883474255", "0883473283", "1573245488", "067162248X", "0743243153", "1568389809", "159285849X", "0866834605", "0875161561", "1570252246", "1439102163", "0870290010", "1568381417", "1419381229", "0446303380", "0910034796", "1616495332", "006074104X", "0671400525", "1568385587", "1568387989", "0894867555", "0062505890", "0310201071", "1594481881", "1592407331", "0310247454", "0895051834", "1118076737", "0060095806", "0896939383", "0062506048", "1592403352", "1556202822", "0071385649", "0310606314", "0061122432", "1592851614", "0061129739", "0671640755", "0442241933", "0310225590", "1608827607", "1592854869", "0345487427", "0471785385", "0553266462", "1558741127", "1573243140", "0785263772", "0916682579", "0553263900", "0910034311", "0932194176", "1592857337", "0440506255", "0684848066", "0688094554", "0061777129", "0757303234", "0553371320", "0898621283", "068484723X", "1572242094", "0915811928", "1604078510", "1878424319", "0465016901", "0310494818", "0060507225", "0060081589", "1401903479"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1559242833", "0451165225", "0883473240", "0883473224"]}},

The local police force work with Fred to solve the mystery of this vandal who bears a grudge against Christianity. In the wake of the crime, there is uproar at the Archdeacon's reactionary measures, but Fred finds himself in the gleeful position of being able to side with his clergy against the old tyrant.  A Palm Sunday outing for the children of the Bryfelin Estate turns to a drunken afternoon for their irresponsible parents; but Fred's spirits are lifted as he takes the wedding service of his curate, Hugh -- a wet, but thoroughly happy occasion.

David is an unlikely candidate for priesthood, with a lingering aversion to churches and a propensity to become entangled in the doings of his little flock. Weddings, births, and the rhythm of life in a small community home to interesting characters provide the often poignant and sometimes comical vignettes in the book. There's plenty of  humor--as when bats upset the Holy Week services or David celebrates communion in the TV room of the Eastwith old people's home--juxtaposed with tender scenes of David christening the gypsy babies or keeping vigil with June Goodmanham after a premature delivery. When the vicar becomes increasingly fascinated with the schoolteacher, Rebecca Weighton, the result is predictable, but welcome. There are no upsetting revelations or villainous characters here, just lovable folks and a mellow, feel-good trip for the reader.--Cindy Crosby--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "A Vicar's Diary", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SNZ8R3ASL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007100078"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 3562266}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0006385419", "description": "Of the varieties of anti-Americanism in the world, the Canadian strain has the oldest lineage, and according to this noted Canadian historian, it is finished as a factor in Canadian politics. With the failure to stop the 1988 FTA (the precursor to NAFTA), anti-Americanism seems dead, but for the two preceding centuries it had a boisterous run and affected many elections. Usually, the Tories played the anti^-Uncle Sam card, and Granatstein renders their campaigns of 1891 and 1911 in strong hues, as the Conservatives depicted \"reciprocity\" (low tariffs negotiated by the Liberals) as a sellout of Canadian independence. Fifty years later, the Tories were still at it, as Prime Minister Diefenbaker loudly beat the Yankees-out drum, yet lost the 1963 election. However, political antipathy to the southern colossus continued through the '60s and '70s, as Granatstein underscores its manifestations in disparate intellectual and economic areas. This lively presentation, ending with the waning of protectionism in the '80s, surely fills a subject gap in many American libraries.Gilbert Taylor--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JK8JT81AL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0820331139"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 2193415}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0006379737", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Within the vast body of WW II literature, only a few volumes examine the five-year German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands. The seemingly peaceful takeover has long been viewed as a historical curio; it was the only incidence in which British territory fell under Nazi rule. Bunting, a reporter for Britain's Guardian newspaper, takes a sociologist's view of the episode, examining the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands as an indicator of how a small, closed community coped with the trauma of a forced takeover. Relying on previously untapped archives in the Channel Islands and Moscow, plus other sources, she has produced a captivating study of life during the \"model occupation.\" On the surface, the islanders' behavior toward the Nazis was shocking. Unlike most citizens in other occupied lands, residents of the Channel Islands acquiesced to German rule, to the point of helping to round up local Jews. But Bunting shows that there were strong pockets of defiance and allows the islanders to make the case that in their isolated location, they cooperated for the sake of survival. The author, who took as her research motto, \"There but for the grace of God go I,\" clearly has taken pains to present truth. She has produced a model study.

British author Keay tells an ambitious story with sweep and brio, encompassing the company's origins as a \"bane of bedraggled pioneers\" in search of spices in the remote Indonesian archipelago; its role in the 1690 founding of Calcutta (an episode of \"commercial greed and political mayhem\"); and the opening up of China in 1700, which was to become the company's most profitable trade. Keay not only portays some of the adventurers and potentates who encountered one another but also grasps the details of trade, some more momentous than others: one missive from London to India mixed declarations of war with Spain and complaints about a bar bill. The company's monopoly charter was eventually broken not by rival traders but by British manufacturers wanting more overseas outlets for their products. If, as Keay notes, there are \"enough incomplete histories of the Company to justify a health warning,\" then this book is a salubrious contribution.

{"asin": "0006385141", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "An admiring, rather placid biography of the Canadian filmmaker and wilderness proponent Bill Mason. Mason is best known for his films: Paddle to the Sea, adapted from a children's book about a little carved Indian canoeing and adventuring from Lake Superior to the Atlantic, and Cry of the Wild, his short feature in praise of wolves. He was also the author of several bestselling books on canoeing techniques and history (Path of the Paddle and Song of the Paddle). He brought to all of his various labors both knowledge and love of the great outdoors, as well as doses of Christian sermonizing. It didn't hurt that just as Mason was refining his artistry, during the 1960s and '70s, a great wave of environmental appreciation and concern broke across North America and Europe, giving his material additional currency and power. Raffan's (Outdoor and Experiential Education/Queens Univ., Ontario) biography is a linear model, starting at the beginning--Mason's early days in Winnipeg, his schooling, with much consideration given to his short stature--on through his start in commercial art and photography, his marriage and family life, his breakthrough into directing films, his abandonment of filmmaking and retreat into painting (no critical success there, nor much self-satisfaction), to his death at 59, in 1988, of cancer. There are plenty of excerpts from his journals and letters, but a clear picture of the man never emerges. Perhaps this has to do with Mason's religious bent, with which Raffan seems uncomfortable; you can almost feel him cringe when Mason talks of nature as ``God's creation'' and refers to the outdoors as ``this blessed wilderness.'' Raffan is much happier with Mason the environmental advocate, the canoeist, the guy who should have been a voyageur but was born 200 years too late. Lots of facts, background, and stories, but Mason never gets the breath of life from Raffan. --Copyright &copy;1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Only in Botswana does democracy work; elsewhere, the \"Big Man Disease\" prevails, notes the author. Focusing on individuals but combining travel, history, politics, economics and generalities of African society, Washington Post correspondent Harden explores the indigenous systems that help hold \"the whole sorry mess\" together. He shows how Liberian Samuel Doe's talk about democracy attracted American aid dollars, which he used to shore up the vacillating support of his countrymen. Harden's experiences on a Congo river boat suggest that Zaire is pervaded by the attitude of its president, who has \"made his billions the old-fashioned way. He stole it.\" The account of a trial in Nairobi to determine where to bury a Luo lawyer is an allegory for the most wrenching conflict of modern African life: the rub between tribal tradition and modern Western values.

{"asin": "0006479359", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The author of the well-reviewed Divorcing Jack returns with another side-splittingly funny, irreverent tale of violence in Northern Ireland. Miller, its antihero, is a smart-ass, hard-drinking bicycle-riding young journalist who gets banished from a busy Belfast daily (for being \"over the top way out pissed as fuck stocious\" drunk in the office) to a boring weekly in Crossmaheart, a rural terrorist hot spot. He's not immediately welcomed at the Chronicle, where his new colleagues bitterly inform him that it's \"normal practice to wait until a body shows up before giving a man's job away.\" Jamie Milburn, Miller's predecessor at the Chronicle, has disappeared. Pursuing the mystery, Miller rides his bike, which he calls the \"Cycle of Violence,\" falls in love with Jamie's gal, Marie, and investigates?and possibly precipitates?a real cycle of violence that hurtles to a fascinating, devastating finale. Bateman's forte is that, without directly addressing Northern Ireland's military/ paramilitary confrontation, the book is drenched and reeking with the pervasive violence and fear of a war-torn state. As the tale unfolds, lives splinter and explode as savagely as the bombs that rock Main Street. This horror is cleverly framed with the blinding sparkle of dark Northern Irish wit?humor so black that it will have readers chuckling even while it reveals the dreadful realities that laughter pretends to camouflage. We probably learn more about life in Northern Ireland from this brilliant, often hilarious novel than from a year of Sunday magazine specials.

We are also introduced to some air squadrons from both sides and their marvelous dogfights. In one tactile scene, a pilot rolls his craft and banks sharply to avoid flak; he \"browns out\" and then finds himself far over the desert, momentarily quite lost. Nonetheless, Schramm and Lampard steal the show, chasing each other, cracking jokes--they are really quite alike, and, seen through their eyes, war is a grim but also a joyous affair. Even the plague of flies that follows these sweating men every step of the way can seem amusing: \"If they followed Lampard rather more faithfully it was not because he was the officer but because he was six foot two and there was more of him to overheat.\" Robinson is extremely funny, actually, and subtle, which lifts his writing out of the genre; even so, he's not much interested in causes or in the meaninglessness of war. Of course it's meaningless, he might say. He wants to focus on young men in a great adventure, risking their lives and loving it, playing deadly games with complicated, deadly machinery. \"Men are always killing themselves to prove their manhood,\" says a woman at Paul Schramm's funeral.

{"asin": "0006481434", "description": "Maillard accurately describes his adult fairy tale as \"a novel about a girl who should have been a boy and a boy who should have been a girl.\" Two Strand River transcends the boundaries between the sexes, between humanity and nature, and between imagination and reality. Although they navigate a physical world that seems soap-opera small, Maillard's characters orbit a rich spiritual terrain. Alan Lehman is a beautician who feels trapped in a male body. His transformation into Ellen, a graceful and confident woman, is aided by Mildred Mackenzie, the mystical mother of one of his customers. \"You're split along a certain seam,\" she explains to him, \"And we have to break you there so you can open.\" Leslie Fraser is a washed-up competitive swimmer turned children's librarian who also finds herself pulled between identities. Central to Two Strand River is this theme of wrenching open, of doing away with conventions, in order to reach a deeper understanding. From Alan's niece to Leslie's oldest brother, each character finds a different type of satisfaction by moving past the familiar into the unknown. This makes for interesting characters but also for a rather wan plot and little narrative drive. For those interested in a book about transcendent spirituality, about characters finding themselves, this book, originally published in Canada, in 1976, has much to recommend it. For those searching for literature, it comes up short.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Two Strand River", "price": 9.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KDyQC-KbL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 8828306}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0006475043", "description": "A novel that mentions, albeit fleetingly, a \"wonderful new musical\" entitled Gimme Back My Pork Chop can't be all bad; indeed, this witty sequel to Boys Like Us is just about all good. In three segments covering the period from November 1989 to May 1990, McGehee continues his exuberant chronicle of Zero McNoo, a shimmering beacon of Toronto's gay set. Zero meets Jeff at an AIDS-research benefit: it seems serious. We meet Zero's oddball family, assembled for an Arkansas wedding: it looks hilarious. (Readers overcome with laughter may wonder what Dear Abby counsels about shoot-'em-ups at nuptial receptions.) The book charms by not trying to; relying on keenly rendered dialogue, McGehee shunts his vivid characters effortlessly between high comedy and drama. (AIDS and \"the camaraderie of the front lines\" are never distant, and are handled with a sensitive, never melodramatic touch.) Though not quite as loopy as it apparently intends to be, the book's almost palpable sweetness creates a winning pastiche. The author's obvious affection for and thorough understanding of his eccentric cast infuses the tale with a cuddly, comic romanticism. Sadly, readers will be deprived of this lovable hero's further adventures: McGehee died of AIDS last September.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Sweetheart", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RBLQWMh0L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312069138"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 13772556}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Harried L.A. lawyer Mickey Murphy is plagued by a slew of eccentrics who fully bear out the book's epigraph: \"If America is a lunatic asylum then California is the Violent Ward.\" Among them are an ex-wife who tries to get more alimony by perching on the ledge outside his office, a slightly over-the-hill actor in search of a handgun, a Robert Maxwell clone called Sir Jeremy Westbridge and a Trump-like entrepreneur named Zach Petrovich, who owns Murphy's law firm and is married to his high school sweetheart. Their maneuverings spark a complicated plot whose many ramifications include a charitable organization that doubles as a clearinghouse for those seeking to fake their own deaths and the set-up of a tax-free Peruvian corporation through the use of bearer shares, but Murphy keeps all the craziness in perspective with a first-person narration that unfolds as a series of quiet, subtle surprises. Told in perfect Dashiell Hammett style, with the clues all noted but never underlined, this novel respects the reader's intelligence and almost begs for a rereading just to savor how skillfully Deighton has woven everything together.

Parker discusses awarding the role of Evita to her, how she prepared both as a vocalist and as a representation of a historical character, and the various problems encountered in the locations (which included having to personally secure permission from the current Argentine president to use the balcony of the presidential office building to film the cornerstone moment of the movie, Evita singing \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\").

{"asin": "0006476155", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This second big winter thriller by a writer named Patterson (see Fiction Forecasts, Oct. 19) features a villain (a multiple-personality serial killer/kidnapper) whom the publisher hopes will remind readers of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, and a hero who is compared to those of Jonathan Kellerman. Unfortunately, the novel has few merits of its own to set against those authors' works. Hero Alex Cross is in fact a black senior detective in Washington, D.C., who is also a psychiatrist and has a facile but not entirely convincing line of sentimental-cynical patter. The villain is Gary Soneji/Murphy (read Hyde/Jekyll), who kills for recognition, and finally kidnaps the kids of prominent parents. Alex is soon on the case, more enraged by Gary's killing of poor ghetto blacks than by the Lindbergh-inspired kidnapping, and becomes involved with a gorgeous, motorcycle-riding Secret Service supervisor who is not what she seems. Soneji/Murphy is eventually captured--but can the bad part of him be proven guilty? There is even a hint at the end that he may survive for a sequel, though the reader has virtually forgotten him by then. Spider reads fluently enough, but its action and characters seem to have come out of some movie-inspired never-never land. If a contemporary would-be nail-biter is to thrill as it should, it urgently needs stronger connections to reality than this book has.

He is Hollywood's answer to Ahab, so he deserves a great big book.Nor will fans be disappointed to hear Winslet break character--she plays an upper-class lass from the stuffiest circles--and explain how she helped her costar prepare for their first scene together, in which she stripped for her dishy portrait. &quot;I was naked in front of Leo on the first day of shooting,&quot; says Winslet in the book. &quot;She had no shame with it,&quot; says DiCaprio, who apparently despises shame. &quot;She wanted to break the ice a little beforehand, so she flashed me. I wasn't prepared for that, so she had one up on me. I was pretty comfortable after that.&quot;While the stars were getting acquainted and the wild-eyed director was figuring out historically unprecedented ways of blending live footage with computer imagery (&quot;Cheat the size of the tugboats 10 percent smaller ... It will make the ship look even more majestic as it leaves Southampton!&quot;), the core cast of 150 extras was taking a crash course in manners. Etiquette coach and choreographer Lynne Hockney even taught the Core (as they were called) that there was a proper way to laugh. &quot;It was the Gilded Age, a time of the grand hostess, lavish parties and tireless pleasure-seeking,&quot; Hockney says in the book. &quot;And each social class was scrambling to reach the one above it.

At 39, Langston Cane V is divorced, childless, uprooted, and a failed writer. Prompted by an elderly mentor to write about his forebear's illustrious past, Langston decides to investigate the family lore that claims the first Langston Cane died fighting alongside John Brown at Harpers Ferry in 1859. His research takes him to Baltimore, where half the family lives?among them his tough-talking, corpulent Aunt Milly, who's kept her distance from Langston's side of the Cane clan since Langston's parents' marriage. As he pieces together the puzzle of the past through Milly's stories, diary entries, newspaper clippings, letters and ephemera, Langston's own life appears in sharper focus. His Virgil in urban education is Yoyo, an entrepreneuring Cameroonian illegal immigrant. Langston survives a drive-by shooting, experiences a sexual rejuvenation with a young woman from Milly's church and discovers an old scandal involving his aunt. Hill's (Some Great Thing) generous spirit expands over a wide and variegated landscape of human relations; he forgives oppression and reconciles himself to history with surprising equanimity. His straightforward, good-humored prose, however, seems too deferent to the richness of the story being told. A touch of lyricism would limber up this lengthy work.

Charged by the Master Pilot with discovering the reason behind the destruction of numerous star systems, Danlo takes his diamond-skinned starship on a quest that is hindered by predictable plotting and stilted dialogue (\"You speak in paradoxes and riddles\"). Zindell creates a universe loaded with spectacle: computers so immense that their components form orbital rings around suns, artificial intelligence that has evolved to godhood and technology that can shatter stars into novas. But Zindell's narrative conflicts are merely retread versions of plot devices that click with near-cliche familiarity.

As a participant in a college research project on hypnotic regression, Jo Clifford is almost too good a subject. Under hypnosis, she relives the final, tortured moments in the life of Matilda, a 12th century Welshwoman. In the process, Jo herself comes close to death. The story then jumps 15 years. Jo, now a journalist researching regression, is again hypnotized and again regresses to Matilda's excitement-packed life. Unfortunately, the pace of the early pages is not maintained. The problem is not with Jo/Matilda, who are both well-drawn, or even with the whopping coincidences Jo encounters. What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. This is still a good read, but it could have been better.

The redoubtable Ida \"Jack\" Troutbeck, Mistress of St. Mary's College, Cambridge (seen in Matricide at St. Martha's), about to be elevated to the House of Lords, imperiously enlists the bookish Amiss to assist her in her latest campaign, namely to defend the ancient British tradition of fox-hunting from an all-out assault by various animal-rights activists. Amiss doesn't quite approve of hunting, but that doesn't deter Troutbeck: \"Bugger your moral susceptibilities,\" she orders, and he does. While the opposition counts among its supporters the likes of Brother Francis (Lord Purseglove), whose vapid nature poetry would embarrass a bunny rabbit, Troutbeck's allies include a couple of boorish lords who must be controlled, while the Rights of Animals League proves a formidable foe. Troutbeck is great fun?a woman of large and lusty appetites who demolishes arguments or a glass of whisky with equal gusto. Amiss is swept along in her wake as the war of words and wits turns to a murderous assault in the House of Lords that leaves several members dead and others shaken.

Still mourning the death of her lover, Richard, Kate is hired by two \"barely comprehensible Glaswegian musicians\" to find out who is trashing their band's reputation by sending goons to break up their shows. She hasn't time to troll Manchester's music scene before friends complicate things by dropping bombshells. First, her business partner announces he's selling his share of the shop and moving to Australia; unfortunately, Kate lacks the funds to buy him out. Then her best friend, Alexis, says that she and her pregnant lover, Christine, need help. The gynecologist who, as Alexis puts it, \"worked with us\" on the pregnancy has been murdered, and Alexis believes that if Kate doesn't steal the relevant medical files they'll lose the baby. And that's if Kate can figure out who the doctor is: Alexis knows her as Helen Maitland, but the newspapers call her Sarah Blackstone. By the time Kate figures out who stabbed the mysterious doctor, she has forgotten why she's looking. But as Kate cruises along, whether setting up a trap with her chum DCI Della Prentice or cutting a deal with the \"Godfather of Manchester\" (who has a fake Italian accent), readers will happily keep up, even if it leaves them a little breathless.

An  introductory essay, written by Ali and Hauser, discusses these powerful  issues and promotes empathy and awareness. Subsequent pages of the  journal contain one or more illuminating quotations by a philosopher, a  public figure or from a religious text, with space available on  alternate pages for the reader to record his or her own thoughts.Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understandingcan help  each of us make a difference and Muhammad Ali is the ideal person to  teach us how. Ali and Hauser&#39;s message is simple: \"If today&#39;s  world is to be truly to be healed, that healing must be achieved one  person at a time. The tolerance and understanding necessary to heal  must come from each and every one of us, arising out of our everyday  conduct, until decency reaches a flood tide.\"Thomas Hauser is the  author of nineteen books, both fiction and nonfiction, includingMuhammad Ali: His Life and Times, which was hailed by theNew  York Timesas \"The definitive Ali biography, incomparable and  indispensable.\" The book was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and the  National Book Award, and was awarded the prestigious William Hill book  of the year prize in England.

Joan Scudamore, housewife and mother of three grown children, is happy, remarkably self-satisfied, and not-at-all introspective. Trapped alone in a foreign rest house she has nothing to do but reconsider her life. Self-analysis is at first unpleasant and then terrifying, as Joan probes deeper and deeper into her memories of interpersonal relationships. At last, mentally stripped to the core, she must reconstruct herself to face the future. All this is written in Christie's deceptively simple, direct style.

{"asin": "000649885X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Robin Hobb, author of the Farseer trilogy, has returned to that world  for a new series.Ship of Magicis a sea tale, reminiscent ofMoby DickandPatrick O'Brian'sAubrey/Maturin series in its details of shipboard life. It is also a fantasy adventure with sea serpents, pirates, and  all sorts of magic. Theliveshipshave distinct personalities and partner with specific people, somewhat likeAnne McCaffrey'sBrain ships and their Brawns, though these are trading ships and have full  crews.Hobb has peopled the book with many wonderfully developed characters.  Most of the primary ones are members of the Vestritts, an Old Trader family which owns the liveshipVivacia.  Their stories are intercut with those of Kennit, the ambitious pirate Brashen, the disinherited scion of another family who served on the Vestritt's ship, andParagon, an old liveship  abandoned and believed mad.   The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.ThoughShip of Magicis full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book. Readers who resent being left with many questions and few answers after almost 700 pages should think twice before starting, or wait until the rest of the series is out so that their suspense won't be too prolonged.

After Grace dies, Neville marries socialite Dido Tallent, but when their first child dies at birth, his faith in both God and his own motives is rocked. In crisis, Neville asks his colleague Jon Darrow (narrator of Glamorous Powers ) for spiritual first aid and, guided by a wise abbot friend of Jon's, is forced to an honest appraisal of himself and his ambition--which has its roots in his early life. He struggles back to spiritual health and eventually emerges a wiser man, more honest and loving toward his family and his flock. This is the third in Howatch's incomparable series about the Church of England in the 20th century; it's a measure of her achievement that, besides telling a fascinating story boldly and well, she illuminates often quite abstruse religious and ecclesiastical questions. Here, Neville's ministry to captured Germans in a local prisoner-of-war camp leads to the discussion of Christian--ethical, moral--behavior during war, a topic that can never be out of date.

She begins to pull herself together when a journalist tells her that the crash was no accident, that it was a terrorist bombing covered up by the world's intelligence agencies. Then the journalist is murdered, and Stephanie is recruited into a shadowy law enforcement agency to become a killer. If the plot of this first novel sounds a little like the movie and TV seriesLa Femme Nikita, that's understandable. But Burnell manages to inject some new life into the tired premise. Stephanie is a tough, resilient heroine, seriously challenged by the multiple personalities she's forced to don, while focused laserlike on avenging her family's death. Even the terrorists emerge as more than cardboard cutouts, especially in the climactic scene in which Stephanie confronts her antagonist. What begins as a B-movie knockoff ends as an entertaining meditation on the futility of terrorist brinkmanship.George Needham--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Rhythm Section", "price": 8.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 944761}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CHGE41JSL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007152647", "0062037862", "0060194669", "0002259176", "0062037943", "0006513387", "0061030023", "0062038028", "1439140219", "0007152663", "1590201132"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007152647", "0007152663", "0062037943", "0062038052"]}},

Author Dennis Jones weaves an intricately threaded story around these classic characters in this action-packed tale.The Ascendancy is rotting from the inside out. Archates, incompetent Dynast, is fearful and easily manipulated, willing to sacrifice his kingdom, his people, and even his own daughters to preserve himself. The barbarian Tathars are on the march, taking advantage of the Dynast's cowardice and slowly crushing the Ascendancy. Evil Erkai the Chain aids the Tathars with his forbidden Black Craft--the magic of death. In the middle of this desperate situation, the luminessa Mandine, uncertain heir to the Ascendancy throne, experiences a vision in which the God and Goddess instruct her to find the Signata, enigmatic tool of Deep Magic. If she succeeds, Erkai and the Tathars can be defeated. If not, the universe will be threatened by unspeakable evil. To make matters worse, Mandine's stepsister Theatana has designs on the throne and is willing to torture, kill, and dabble in the Black Craft to get it.But never fear, our plucky heroine doesn't have to go it alone. She's got the able strength of hunky Key Brander at her side, not to mention the assistance of the mysterious forest-folk, the hemandri, and their familiars, the small dragon-like pandragore.

{"asin": "0006512666", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The dazzling pyrotechnics of British author Smith's last two future noir spectacles, Spares (under option to DreamWorks) and One of Us (under option to Warner Brothers), are prefigured in his promise-filled debut novel, a 1994 U.K. paperback original now seeing its first hardcover publication. Set in a stylized future City where individuals live in neighborhoods organically responsive to their moods and lifestyles, the story begins as a routine missing persons case for its narrator, Stark, an irreverent soft-boiled detective type who specializes in \"finding people, or things.\" Stark's retrieval of Fell Alkland, a scientist who has fled the driven environment of Action Center for the placid Stable neighborhood, proves relatively easy. But pursuit by Action Center operatives and Alkland's crippling work-related nightmares force Stark and his quarry to escape to Jeamland, a collective repository of dreams and childhood memories that Stark appears to know very well, and to which, as he discovers only belatedly, he has been lured back deliberately. The genius of Smith's narrative is its casual revelation that the detective scenario and detailed elaborations of the City that pull the reader into the story are clue-filled set-ups for the real story of Stark's self-discovery in Jeamland. Ultimately, this requires chapters of explanatory exposition that slow down the finale and betray the awkwardness of a new writer growing into his skills. Nevertheless, the story blazes with a visionary intensity that fires its imagery and fuels its premise that \"once you've gone forward, you can't go home again.\" (Dec.)Philip K.

Her debut novel is an unpretentious gem of a book that charts the late coming-of-age of Miss Julia Garnet, a retired English schoolteacher who spends six months in Venice after her lifelong companion, Harriet, dies. Venice has a magical effect on reserved Julia: a dyed-in-the-wool Communist, she relaxes in her antipathy toward religion, and even begins to visit the local church. There, she becomes enamored of a series of paintings that tell the story of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, a tale that mixes elements of Judaism with the religion of Zoroaster. In the story, young Tobias travels to Medea, part of the Persian Empire, to collect a debt for his father, blind Tobit. He is accompanied on his journey by a hired guide who turns out to be the Angel Raphael. As Julia learns more about Tobias's trek, she embarks upon a soul-altering journey of her own. She falls in love with an art dealer, Carlo, and befriends Sarah and Toby, twins working on the restoration of a Venetian chapel. When Toby disappears suddenly, after discovering a priceless Renaissance painting, Julia finds out that neither Carlo nor the twins are exactly what they seem--but that the Angel Raphael's watchful spirit will help good prevail. (Feb.)Forecast: This touching novel, a sleeper hit in Britain, should win American fans eager for a treatment of religious themes without the gooey sentiment that often accompanies the topic of angels.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Miss Garnet's Angel", "price": 12.61, "salesRank": {"Books": 1004728}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NkkYdXfIL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0670785679", "0312423802", "0142180971", "0156983567", "0312569327", "0312426798", "1931257493", "B006CDMGMO", "0312269552", "0553581414", "0758263228"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0142180564", "0142180971", "0312423802", "B006CDMGMO"]}},

{"asin": "0006514006", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Sisterly rivalry is the basis of this fresh, wonderfully vivid retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn. Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king's court at a young age, as players in their uncle's plans to advance the family's fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII's favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (\"kin and enemies all at once\") feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Other Boleyn Girl", "price": 8.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2223030}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BLEBMtJ6L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0743272498", "1439124671", "0743269268", "0743246071", "1416549145", "074327251X", "1451626088", "1416563717", "1476735484", "1476746303", "1416590889", "145162610X", "1451626096", "B0012QE4Q2", "1451629559", "0802136834", "1451626118", "0743272501", "1402224680", "0743249313", "0743249305", "1451626126", "0743249291", "145162607X", "0743272528", "074327248X", "0743272544", "1416563687", "0743256158", "0743269829", "1416549129", "0345407865", "145165684X", "1402214316", "0778314316", "0345453220", "1416563725", "1451629540", "1416563709", "B0064X92RY", "0743272536", "B00EBFE5RY", "1482702371", "0312194390", "B001L57ZZG", "0345495365", "0345391780", "0312429983", "1416593144", "0345495349", "0312374615", "1451648626", "0446550124", "0385489498", "1402265581", "145162686X", "0743296443", "0425230082", "B0058M7Z1C", "0451237897", "B00114XM04", "0679781587", "B000RF7XYY", "1491280093", "0544222881", "1405134631", "0385338139", "0143124927", "B0031MA7SO", "0312370849", "0345453247", "B00E1LT41K", "1402237669", "1451633246", "0743454537", "B004E3XDGC", "014242417X", "0440212561", "1416547819", "1565125606", "0316228583", "0375842209", "B007PM0W3Q", "125002417X", "0451223136", "1439153663", "B000Z8H0IC", "0375847227", "0312378025", "1451617488", "B000ZOXDFA", "0312382456", "0345404335", "0062280678", "0440215625", "1451681755", "1451635621", "B001FE1DKG", "014241493X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0743272498", "B0012QE4Q2", "1439124671", "1416563717"]}},

{"asin": "0006514642", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The author of the Wideacre trilogy offers another intense, absorbing tale, a grisly drama of passion and witchcraft in 16th-century England. Growing up as an ill-used apprentice to Morach, the much-feared wise woman of the moors, Alys finds respite by joining an order of Catholic nuns. When young Lord Hugo and his men burn the abbey to the ground during a drunken rampage, Alys is the only one to escape; she flees back to Morach, consumed with guilt at having abandoned her dying sisters. Summoned to minister to Lord Hugh, Hugo's father, Alys soon finds herself deeply involved in the treachery and intrigue surrounding the old man's attempts to have his son's marriage to the barren Lady Catherine annulled. Attracted to Hugo despite his murderous past, Alys begins to practice witchcraft in earnest to rid him of Catherine and become his wife. Her spells work all too well: Catherine's long-awaited pregnancy ends disastrously, and Hugo comes to love Alys, but in a sickly haze of lust that provides no basis for marriage. Alys soon finds herself so sunk in evil, so removed from God's love, that only a truly shocking gesture can bring about her salvation. Gregory adeptly manipulates hair-raising horror and mounting suspense, brilliantly evoking the period's turbulent atmosphere.

In addition to an informative narrative of the U.N.'s frustrating attempts to limit Saddam's weapons program, Trevan offers a valuable perspective on U.N. bureaucracy at a time when the organization is trying to assert its power and influence around the world. He describes the personal dynamics that replace national loyalties; the emphasis on negotiating finesse and the careful parsing of written agreements; the heavy dependence on leaks, back-channeling and spin. From the beginning, Iraqi officials placed every possible obstacle in UNSCOM's path. The deception and evasions were, in Trevan's view, as brazen as they were comprehensive. In the resulting game of \"catch us if you can,\" UNSCOMAwith significant help from Israeli intelligenceAscored its share of limited, specific successes. In Trevan's final analysis, however, the triumphs were ephemeral as Saddam Hussein continued his weapons research programs, inconvenienced but unthwarted. Not surprisingly, Trevan concludes that \"Iraq was not interested in cooperating with UNSCOM.\" To the book's fundamental questionAhow can democracies force a hostile nondemocracy to \"be good\" without compromising democratic principles?ATrevan offers some answers in an epilogue. He argues for an increasing transfer of both sovereignty and power to international organizations, specifically the U.N.

{"asin": "0006531563", "description": "A scholar who was awarded the Wolfson Prize for History for 1990's The Architecture of Medieval Britain: A Social History, Platt focuses on the economic, political, religious and cultural factors that enabled the creation of art, tending to gloss over the art itself. The book proves repeatedly that, in the words of Philip Hamerton, \"the man who has money will rule the man who has art\" and examines how the Black Death, the French Revolution and other historical turning points affected art production. Initially, churches' stained glass and altarpieces comprised the entirety of the art world. Eventually, churches were adorned with frescoes, paintings and statuary, and still later, art began to be commissioned for civic beautification and decoration, as a status symbol or a political tool, as an investment and for private enjoyment. Platt assumes the reader is conversant in art history and familiar with myriad politicians and religious figures, and his abrupt references give the book a choppy feel and tend to muddy lines of argument. Casual readers may have trouble with this sweeping history, but specialists and those with an art history background will find Platt's work illuminating and relentlessly informative. 32 pages of color reproductions.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Isobel needs money to support her ailing husband, Philip, and his newfound interest in pool building, so when her agent, Troy Cartwright, informs her that her literary novels are earning less and less, she tells him, \"If they won't pay me to write good books, then I'll just have to write bad.\" She and Troy invent the persona of Zelda Vere, a heavily made-up, well-dressed blonde bombshell, the opposite of 52-year-old country matron Isobel. Zelda's \"survivor fiction,\" The Devil's Disciple, is a major hit that earns Isobel all the money she could ever need, but she finds herself increasingly caught between superego and id, between an unfulfilling loyal marriage and sexual experimentation with Troy. When Isobel sets off on her book tour with Troy, Gregory's plot takes an exotic and erotic turn, depicting a world of cross-dressing, cocaine and champagne. Returning to her home in Kent, Isobel finds Philip miraculously recovered and expending all his energy on the construction of an expensive new pool. Philip has also decided to invest (with Isobel's money) in the handsome pool man's business. Backstabbers reveal themselves, to no one's surprise, and Isobel's deliberationsAshould she stay or should she go?Aare prolonged until an abrupt, bewildering denouement puts a stop to the runaway narrative. Gregory, a popular writer of historical fiction (Earthly Joys, etc.), knows whereof she speaks when she describes television interviews and book deals, though the over-the-top fantasy she spins from the details may test readers' patience.

{"asin": "0006531113", "description": "After ten years, it is easy to forget that Germany was a divided country for more than 40 years. Post-World War II politics determined that Nazi Germany would be divided into two parts: a Western democratic country influenced by the Americans, British, and French and an Eastern Socialist/Communist country influenced by the former Soviet Union. What remains of this artificial divide? German-born and Oxford-educated August, a Times correspondent who has recently received the Anglo-German Foundation Journalism Award, tries to answer this question in an engrossing account of his search for the physical and social remnants of the border that once divided West and East Germany. As August meticulously wends his way down the former frontier, he encounters difficulties in finding the actual border but has no problem reporting on conversations with residents who have lingering doubts about the advantages of unification and the possibility of creating a truly unified Germany. This is a fearless, critical, accurate, and balanced assessment of the complicated political and social situation that will fester despite the elimination of a strong, physical barrier. Highly recommended for all European travel and history collections. Olga B.

WhenTruthmagazine reporter Katherine Johnson starts looking too closely at the life of millionaire socialite and mob boss Jack Fox, however, the veneer of gentility dissolves immediately. Her body is found one morning floating in the East River, and the coroner suspects foul play.Wrenched by the pain of his loss, her ex-husband--former FBI agent Blake Johnson--decides to take the law into his own hands. In fact, as part of the secret White House department known as The Basement, Blake actually has the president's permission to take out Fox in the best way he sees fit. As Blake begins his Fox hunt,Day of Reckoningevolves into an international duel between the masterminds of justice and criminality.

And Fox matches him at every turn.While the contest between the power brokers is compelling on the surface, Higgins is unable to infuse his characters with enough life to make the story as engaging as it might have been.

In consumer terms, fuzzy logic is behind such \"smart\" machines as air conditioners and microwave ovens that gauge their operation to the conditions and demands of a given moment's task.

Using numerous interviews and anecdotes, Baxter sketches a picture that is never quite flattering, but is empathetic and fascinating. He tells De Niro&#x92;s story through the prism of the actor&#x92;s most notable cinematic endeavors (including Taxi Driver and Raging Bull) as well as through his biggest failures. As a result, the book is equal parts life story and film analysis. This works to great effect, since De Niro&#x92;s artistic choices, many of which involved physical transformations and psychological sparring with his fellow actors, reveal as much, if not more, about his own character as any exposition on the actor&#x92;s life experience. As Baxter portrays him, De Niro appears more comfortable being anyone other than himself. His total immersion into characters such as Travis Bickle spooked his co-stars but won him great acclaim, despite what the author describes as a career decline that began with The King of Comedy. In subsequent years, Baxter notes, De Niro has rested on his reputation, choosing mediocre but commercially viable projects that would, in turn, fund his entrepreneurial pursuits in his beloved lower Manhattan neighborhood. De Niro remains one of cinema&#x92;s most enduring presences, a human puzzle, perhaps even unto himself. 40 b/w photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Virginia Connell, 58, a grieving widow from Dublin, moves to Redlion, takes up golf and finds that there is life after loss. Discontented Irish/Indian Nicole Turner, 23, loves karaoke but dreams of singing professionally. After she's discovered by one of Sam's A & R people, Nicole learns that fame and fortune pale in comparison to her need for independence and love. Surrounding these women are many thoroughly developed supporting characters and sufficient side plots to fuel a sequel. Romance fans should rejoice in this chatty, comfortable story, as warm and satisfying as Irish oatmeal.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "What She Wants", "price": 10.38, "salesRank": {"Books": 7060328}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417ZCGADKWL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1451616767", "0452283388", "1451681402", "B001PO69G4", "B001P5HD54", "B006CDEK6E", "B0058M5CLM", "B001PO69GO", "B003E7EW1O", "0747260583", "0747260575", "1853717967", "0007373678", "0143118498", "0307273571", "0060890681", "0425260933", "0747266352", "1611099285", "0451240596", "125004264X", "0060731486", "0425259692", "1476704511", "0060586133", "0385351852", "0743457463", "1409136612", "0425251896", "0007154054", "0060090383", "0451239687", "1402281293", "1902602692", "0007331444", "1402253168", "1439152810", "0241950589", "0749909307", "1409135411", "B005HKP7XS", "0752883437", "0747243905", "0752884336", "0755343964", "075289336X", "0752865455", "1400097304", "0007466935", "0752847953", "0752883496", "0141028564", "1451609116", "1482385635", "0755378407", "0747257876", "0345462807", "1447208668", "1444706829", "184744458X", "0954491335", "0755343808", "184983203X", "1439107173", "0752883526", "1842231618", "184827081X", "1400097320", "1848270151", "1847562817", "1848270712", "0330520539", "1847562779", "0345462823", "0340932872", "1451606419", "0857380001"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1451681402", "B005Q6ECLG", "0452283388", "B001PO69G4"]}},

Since his forte, \"the long kill\" with the aid of a telescopic lens, is becoming impossible due to his failing eyesight, he phones in his resignation to the man he knows as Jacob in London. Later, the ex-gunman buys a cottage and meets a young widow, Anya Wilson, her small son and her father, whom Jaysmith recognizes as Bryant. The future seems bright for Jaysmith as he and Anya plan marriage, but Jacob suddenly materializes with armed hirelings to dispose of Steven and Anya. Alerted to a conspiracy, Jaysmith braves overwhelming odds in the shoot-out that caps the novel's shocking disclosure.

This account presents edited portions of journal entries written during trips to remote mountain areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kurdistan between 1952 and 1965, as well as numerous black-and-white photographs that he took at the time. Some of these areas are more developed today than they were half a century ago, while others are even more inaccessible owing to political upheavals. Thesiger's writing is sparse, as would be expected from diary entries, and consequently may disappoint those looking for more detail or seeking current travel information. Those wanting to know more about Thesiger's remarkable life should read his autobiography, The Life of My Choice (LJ 3/15/98), which ought to be an essential purchase even for small public libraries.

French, whose first book, Younghusband, won the 1995 Somerset Maugham Award, tries to do a bit too much. It's difficult to uncover new ground in the well-spaded turf of Indian independence. French is not the first to see Gandhi as a crank obsessed with bowel functions, Winston Churchill as a racist and the 1947 British exit strategy as a case of muddling through. He does, however, succeed at filling in some gaps, especially about British intelligence operations. French (who ran for Britain's parliament as a Green candidate and is currently director of the Free Tibet Campaign) nagged the Foreign Office to declassify 92 \"bottle-green boxes\" of files, and his analysis reveals a dying Raj under severe financial stress held together by undercover operations. Although his criticisms of Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre's Freedom at Midnight are unlikely to dethrone that classic, he argues persuasively that the authors swallowed an elderly Lord Mountbatten's egocentric recollections and inaccurately made the creation of Pakistan a cliff-hanger dependent on the health of Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Noteworthy also are glimpses of various British viceroys, perspectives on the amalgamation of the princely states into the nation and an update on the increasing adulation in India of Axis ally Subhas Chandra Bose. French's travel notes and wit leaven the narrative somewhat, but many readers will find that this demanding journey covers too much territory too quickly.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Liberty or Death: India's Journey to Independence and Division", "price": 12.03, "salesRank": {"Books": 1130881}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81mLi2H4InL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0142001007", "1400034175", "0224039563", "1400078334", "0307700208", "0520207173", "0307473481", "014200412X", "8172238746", "0195393945", "0006376010"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0300143338", "1400034175", "0006376010", "0393318982"]}},

With excerpts from published works by energetic young writers who remain, for the most part, untranslated, de Chamberet, a literary agent who works both sides of the Channel, is determined to rescue French literature from \"cold cerebrality and self-indulgent navel-gazing.\" Reactionary Michel Houellebecq, whose Elementary Particles has just exploded on American shores, will be recognized in the voice of his odious, cynical narrator, who attempts to incite a friend to murder a young woman he desires because love is \"no longer possible,\" in \"The Port of Call.\" A more modestly subversive tale, Marie Desplechin's \"Haiku,\" explores racism among 20-something professionals at a dinner party. Ilan Duran Cohen, in \"Wonderland,\" one of the few emotionally resonant pieces, recounts a young Jewish man's New York-Paris conversations with his mother, who is obsessed with getting her nose fixed. North African-born writers Abdourahman Waberi and Mounsi offer thoughtful father-son stories.

After taking his daily dose of methadone in the morning -- he became readdicted in New York in 1980 -- he spent the afternoons reading and writing right up until his death in August 1997. \"Last Words\" collects these daily jottings in his notebooks, the entire literary output from the last nine months of his life!With only the love of his cats, literature and methadone left, these journals make for unbearably poignant reading. Unlikely as it may sound, Bill Burroughs was only human after all.' The Times  'With his canes, suits and absurd fedoras, William S.

Grauerholz's introduction and notes are a fine mixture of fact and feeling, and make \"Last Words\" a synthetic whole!The journals are an exploration in depth, and in sum, of Burroughs' personality and creative pre-occupations![A] rich repetition, with variations, of a string of half-conscious fancies, scenarios and literary allusions. \"Last Words\" also presents fresh clues to the larger design of his imagination, and a means of gaining a renewed perspective on his work.'

Although he seems more vulnerable than ever before, the anti-establishment anger continues to flare up at odd moments, his skewed sense of humour still sends out sparks.'

Oram's spare text is perfectly complemented by Ross' emphatic cartoon drawings, and their theme of inadequacies accepted is one that should reach children. A funny, original book that manages to bring an old truth (and a young Jenna) home to rest.

{"asin": "0006544754", "description": "In this collection of well-written short stories, Irish writer O'Connor ( Cowboys and Indians ) links together a series of tales concerning such domestic crises as abortion, infidelity and separation. The most exciting is \"The Long Way Home,\" a title with a Celtic ring but a plot reminiscent of a Rod Serling scenario, in which a man leaves his wife one night and picks up a very strange hitchiker. Most of the protagonists are Irish men or women considering big changes in their lives. Some look to England for it, as in \"Last of the Mohicans\" and \"Mothers Were All the Same,\" and almost all are detached from the familiar landscape of Irish fiction. (For once, pubs are left out of the picture, although there is considerable drinking.) An exception is \"The Hills Are Alive,\" which examines the strange double life of IRA volunteer Danny Sullivan. O'Connor's style is terse and graphic, attuned to the voices of his young characters. At times, as in the title story, \"True Believers,\" it proves a powerful literary tool; more often it shows off a tiresome alienation that works well when a story's plot is strong enough to justify it, but sags when the story is no more thna a portrait of several sad characters, as in \"The Bedouin Feast.\"Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "True Believers", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WHS990ZBL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 11220129}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Eyewitness to Evolution, Richard Fortey confirms his status as one of the best communicators of science around today. His hugely enjoyable previous book,Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth, was shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc science book prize, butTrilobite!is sure to receive even greater acclaim. WhereasLifetook the reader on a whistle-stop tour of evolution from start to present--a huge undertaking that necessarily granted little space to each time period or taxonomic group--Trilobite!sees Fortey indulging in a whole book about his overriding paleontological passion, the long extinct and enigmatic creatures of the title. The result is a joy.Trilobites--woodlicelike creatures that dominated the world's oceans long before the time of the dinosaurs--are, arguably, the most beautiful animals that have ever been chipped out of the fossil record. Fortey certainly seems to think so. His enthusiastic, almost loving explanations of the anatomy, ecology, and long evolutionary history of these fascinating vanished creatures carry the reader on an inspirational journey into the Earth's distant past. But the book is much more than a technical treatise on trilobites. We learn about Fortey himself, his formative years as an amateur then professional paleontologist, about his much-loved teachers and colleagues, and above all, about that strange but addictive pastime known as science. You may not find arthropods as charming as Fortey does, but you will not fail to be charmed by the author.

{"asin": "0006545467", "description": "Another very funny, drily British novel by the author of Ease and The Aerodynamics of Pork. Hilary Metcalfe, an English teacher addicted to American musical comedy recordings, celebrates his 25th birthday alone, his gorgeous bisexual lover Rufus having stood him up. In an inebriated state, Hilary discovers an abandoned infant in the subway and takes the baby home to his seedy West London digs above an Indian grocery. Meanwhile, Rufus, unfortunately detained in a female student's bed, steps out of it and almost at once into the arms of Hilary's sister Henry (for Henrietta), a psychiatrist rarely impressed by masculine charm. As the baby wraps his fingers more and more tightly around Hilary's heart, he comes under the ever-watchful eye of his landlord's adoring adolescent daughter, who has made a shrine of his every discarded envelope and wornout shoelace. Now Sumitra recognizes Hilary's true divinity: he is a father who bears his own child, a Prince God. The bawdy narrative strands are cleverly woven together with witty and urbane dialogue and piquant characterization, so that the reader is thoroughly absorbed in this irreverent tour de force.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Kansas in August", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416X3XNA25L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0007313454", "B005Q6BSU4", "0006550746", "0007151004", "052524445X", "0006545459", "0007307683", "0525244999", "0007465084", "0002253836"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 1880432}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0006551807", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French.

When rain starts to fall, she takes shelter in a backyard toolshed. There she finds a small, upset fairy whose tattered wing prevents her from flying away. Amanda rummages through the tools, but nails and screwdrivers won't help. Finally, she runs to the house for a roll of tape. A trial flight proves that the wing is mended, the two shake hands, and Amanda watches with a satisfied smile as her tiny friend flies off. The pantomimed gestures of anguish, despair, curiosity, and gratitude make it easy to tell the tale from Butterworth's neatly framed watercolors.

{"asin": "000655198X", "description": "Broady (Swimmer) literately and artistically probes the dark corners of blue-collar British life in his first short story collection, deftly maneuvering his way through gutbucket settings while displaying his smart, perceptive and often fascinating voice. He's at his best in the longer entries, often taking an appealing conceit and twisting it in a variety of intriguing directions, most notably in \"Bouncing Back,\" a story about the reappearance of some talented and versatile bears in a down-and-out British town. He delves into man's relationship with domestic animals in \"Wrestling Jacob,\" the tale of a lusty architect who sublimates his libido in a series of wrestling matches with a sheep. Broady is also a bit of a literary pub-crawler, choosing saloons for his setting in several stories, the most appealing being \"The Tale of the Golden Bath Taps,\" the story of a musician's very strange relationship with a stripper. Also included is a lovely, glowing tribute to Sun Ra in \"Short Cut to the Sun,\" the description of a night at one of the late musician's wonderfully bizarre concerts. Broady's characters often find themselves taking a winding, choppy road to their destinations, and the author doesn't always connect the dots or fill in the narrative gaps as well as he could. But his sharp, rough-hewn voice sticks out like a wolf in a chicken coop, and this book represents another solid building block in the career of an author who shows signs of becoming a literary star.

{"asin": "0006737447", "description": "Grade 2-3-- This transitional novel from Britain includes three short chapters about the adventures and mischief of young Josie Smith. In each episode, Josie means well, but always seems to get into trouble. In the first chapter, she tries to earn money to buy flowers for her mother's birthday. In a following chapter, after she spills paint on the floor and herself, she decides to run away. After each disaster, her mother comforts and reassures her. Josie is an endearing character, and Nabb includes many funny recurring images, such as how Josie shuts her eyes every time she tells a lie. Humorous black-and-white line drawings appear frequently throughout. While Johanna Hurwitz' characters come more to life, this warm, entertaining book is a good choice for collections needing additional chapter books for beginning readers. --Leslie Barban, Richland County Public Library, Columbia, SCCopyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Josie Smith", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41G5VH032JL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 4837732}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "000655069X", "description": "Writer and journalist Taylor, author of two other works with  African themes, Shaka's Children and The Mighty Nimrod, provides  here snippets of enthralling individual tales complemented with  a thoughtful commentary. Recounting his travels from Lake  Victoria to the Cape of Good Hope, Taylor explores what the  future holds for the white citizens of the black continent in  which he was raised. Although skilled at reporting and  storytelling, Taylor is less successful as a social and  political thinker. His subjects, an eclectic mix, are not  missionaries or explorers and may even lack Livingstone's  dignity and vision. That they are white and living in  sub-Saharan Africa is all that makes them members of  \"Livingstone's tribe.\" The reader is therefore tempted to  conclude that this unimpressive association is a mere outcome of  a nostalgic indulgence. Yet Taylor deserves credit for openly  addressing the precarious fate of many whites who still call  post-independence Africa home. This blend of social history and  travelog may be of interest to travel enthusiasts but is more  suitable for social science collections. Edward K. Owusu-Ansah,  Murray State Univ.

Still, encouraged by his fearless friend George, the two centipedes make several trips to these destinations, where they encounter dangerous creatures and barely make it home with their cuticles intact. Later on, when smoke invades their tunnel, the two frantically crawl through the \"Up Pipe\" and discover a gigantic \"meat mountain\" that they soon realize is a sleeping Hoo-Min. They escape just in time to scuttle down the pipe and revive the smoke-struck Belinda. Having learned the difference between bravery and foolhardiness, they live happily ever after. This simplistic fantasy is a stretch for even the most accepting readers. The characters never develop but remain insects who have human characteristics uncomfortably imposed upon them. The author is often didactic, defining potentially unfamiliar words or explaining the anatomy of centipedes. The humor is more silly than funny, and this attempt to present things through the eyes of insects is far-fetched and uninteresting. A disappointingly dull book.?Wendy D.

It is the story of Thowra, a silvery-white brumby, who becomes leader of his own herd over the course of the book, defeating other stallions and evading the men who try to capture him. This fairly realistic horse story occasionally slips into a more fantastical style, such as when the horses converse with each other and with other animals (cows, kangaroos, dingoes) and when Mitchell attributes human emotions and thoughts to Thowra. Lee's voice walks, trots, canters, and gallops through the story, as appropriate to the action. The book is prefaced with an Australian glossary, primarily consisting of descriptions of the local flora and fauna. There are musical cues for the beginning and end of each chapter as well as each side of the tape.

As he searches for her, he encounters a variety of other creatures, from a kookaburra to a boy. Each asks, \"What can you do, Wombat?\" His neighbors dismiss his answer (\"Not much. I dig a lot and I think a lot\") and show off their own skills. But it's Wombat who saves the day when a forest fire threatensDhe digs a hole large enough to shelter them all. In return, his new friends help him find his mother. Morpurgo (previously paired with Birmingham for The Wreck of the Zanzibar) bolsters his story with pleasing repetitions, and his message about the importance of valuing the contributions of each individual in a community comes through clearly but gently. Birmingham's artwork is no less than sublime. Nimbly sketched animal studies adorn the margins of the pages containing text, and alternate with full-page vistas of the bush and its creatures, their softly smudged outlines gilded with light. Avoiding anthropomorphism, Birmingham nevertheless presents the wombat as an altogether winning creature, small and sturdy and determined.

The frivolity begins as one \"little chameleon all in vermilion / Danced alone in a garden pavilion.\" He is quickly joined by a million companions, who frolic so much that they soon turn green--and take a quantum leap onto a submarine. Succeeding spreads show the carefree chameleons turning pink at a skating rink, blue at the zoo, yellow \"when the beasts began to bellow,\" brown on the merry-go-round and white \"while dancing in the pale moonlight.\" Finally, all tired out after their adventures, \"multicolored, in a tumbled heap, / A million chameleons fell fast asleep.\" Children on the high end of the suggested age group may find the reading level a bit elementary, but readers of all ages will be charmed.

Under a bright, newly designed dust jacket lies the same old beloved Paddington, the always dignified, well-meaning, but troublemaking bear from \"darkest Peru.\" Young readers will enjoy this reissue of the 1962 classic, which includes some of Paddington's best adventures (or misadventures, depending) in the extensive Paddington canon, such as his wild ride on a power lawnmower and his appearance on a game show, where his unusual logic wins him the jackpot. Paddington is, understandably, a favorite character for kids, one they can truly relate to, as his best-laid, well-intentioned plans somehow go topsy-turvy. As always, Bond's prose is fun to read, with the solemn, serious Paddington providing humorous contrast to the absurd goings-on around him. Peggy Fortnum's spare, evocative, often witty line drawings are as wonderful as ever, more representative of Paddington's character than the new jacket art, which makes him look like a cute, cuddly stuffed toy--a portrait with which Paddington himself would take issue.Shelle Rosenfeld--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Paddington at Large", "price": 6.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2275151}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uur4XoePL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007174160", "0006753450", "0006753434", "061831105X", "0006753442", "0006753663", "0618250727", "0006753795", "0007269412", "0006753787", "B004HI79LY", "0061170747", "0062312189", "0060282134", "0060296968", "0061687405", "0007458851", "0007104405", "0395066395", "0689715625", "0618083073", "0142411647", "0061473642", "0618331417", "0395143314", "0006647448", "0395066409", "0395066425"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061170747", "0062312189", "0006753434", "0060296968"]}},

Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out - she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain. No More Meadows, which she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC  - she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children.

{"asin": "0006499945", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "During the biggest snowstorm in the history of Philadelphia, the jury is out. The defense is confident of a verdict of not guilty, but then client Elliot Steere admits to his council that he is a murderer. Marta Richter does not take this revelation happily. In fact, she's so outraged that she wants her client's secret revealed no matter what it does to her career. Steere isn't about to let her blow his chances, and with powerful connections, money, and muscle, he works from his jail cell to silence Marta and her colleagues before the sequestered jury makes a decision. If readers like soap opera?type cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, a plot that reads like a TV script, and a little gory violence here and there, they will like this book. The characters are well thought out, but most often sequences of the story unfold implausibly, as when Marta hunts for clues in her client's house and boat. Attorney Bennie Rosato, the feisty character from a previous Scottoline novel (Legal Tender, LJ 7/96), makes an appearance here but is not very involved in the plot except for a \"save-the-day\" routine in the last few chapters. This is essential for readers already hooked on Scottoline, but don't start with this one when introducing her to readers.-?Shirley Gibson Coleman, Ann Arbor Dist.

In the first book in the series, Curse of the Mistwraith  (1993), the half-brothers dark Arithon s'Ffalenn and blond  Lysaer s'Ilessid were set against each other by the eponymous  enemy, and now, 30-some years later, they're still going after  each other. This book's action begins in mid-flight during a  winter gale, with Arithon fleeing the walled city Jaelot, where  he's been imprisoned. With him he drags the unwilling peasant  Fionn Areth Caid'an, magically raised as his double to trap him.  Soon they join forces with Dakar the Mad Prophet (whose  prophecies have an erratic track record, though some have been  important), assigned by the Fellowship of Sorcerers to defend  our protagonist. Dakar has supplies and horses ready. Much  geography is traversed with many turgid pages spent attempting  to describe the indescribable effects of magic. Occasionally the  focus moves to Lysaer, with his large retinue of soldiers and  fanatic priests, who in private practice rituals as sorcerous as  the techniques of which they accuse Arithon. While fans have  compared this series to Robert Jordan's extended Wheel of Time  series, newcomers may be put off by the stilted language (\"The  guard captain's baleful stillness held threat\") and the mishmash  of plot.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Peril's Gate: Third Book of The Alliance of Light (The Wars of Light and Shadow, Book 6) (The Wars of Light and Shadow series)", "price": 5.69, "salesRank": {"Books": 1107887}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ca2VqL3xL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007101147", "0007217811", "0007102224", "0006482996", "0007217838", "0006482074", "0586210709", "B008SM18OY", "0586210695", "0061054682", "0007101112", "B005EP2URM", "0765326361", "0451451678", "0061054704", "0061057789", "0441432751", "0061054623"], "bought_together": ["0007101147", "0007102224"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007101147", "0007217811", "0006482074", "0586210695"]}},

A student runs away from boarding school and meets an elderly lady, whom he later discovers is a ghost. She tells the story of another boy, Bertie, who grew up long ago in Africa and eventually became her husband. Lonely and neglected by his parents, he rescues an abandoned white lion cub and cares for it, gradually forming a close bond. After some years the boy's parents abruptly decide to send him to school in England and sell the lion. Bertie attempts to save the animal by returning it to the jungle, but it has lost its ability to survive in the wild and returns to the only home it has known. A French circus owner buys the lion, and the boy vows never to forget him. Twelve years later, Bertie fights in World War I and is decorated for rescuing wounded comrades. In a small French town he finally finds his lion, starving and near death, and the two friends are reunited. Heartened by the woman's tale, the student returns to school. This touching story is well written and emotionally satisfying. Readers will be drawn to this fascinating tale of a unique friendship between boy and beast.

He got this job because of his love for travel, an interest he shared with the Archbishop. Together they went around the world, visiting such places as Australia, Africa, Scotland, New York, Alaska and China for their ministry. This book is the result of their journeys. Part memoir, part travelog, Waite's account is  humorous and witty. Hand-drawn illustrations at the beginning of each chapter capture the essence of the tale that is about to unfold. Asides or comments about the country they visited are thrown in at unexpected moments, adding a sparkle of delight to the story as when he emphaszies that not all 20 of the Primates they visited in Scotland arrived in the same taxi. But what makes this book so enjoyable is that the great friendship, affection, and respect that Waite and the Archbishop have for each other really shines throughout each tale.

{"asin": "0007107188", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Grade 5-8-A grandfather tells his grandson about the horrors of war in this story set during the Spanish Civil War. As a youngster, Antonito lived on a small farm outside the village of Sauceda. His father raised strong black bulls for the bullring, or corrida. The boy bonded with a newborn calf after its mother died, and in order to save it, he led Paco into the surrounding hills. While they were away, Franco's soldiers bombed the village. Leaving Paco behind, Antonito returned home, discovering the farm in flames. He escaped back into the safety of the countryside, but couldn't find the calf. Weeks later, suffering from hunger and exhaustion, he was found by his Uncle Juan, a Republican soldier, and nursed back to health. While recuperating, he heard a tale of a large black bull that chased down Nationalist soldiers, and he hoped that it was Paco. Years later, after he dreamed that the creature rested next to him while he slept in the forest, he awakened to discover hoof marks of a massive bull in the still-warm grass. Morpurgo's action-filled novel packs an emotional punch. The author gradually reveals the historical information and narrates the tale with the careful detachment of someone relating a story so awful that he can hardly bear to tell it. Ideal for reluctant readers, this book focuses on the loss and grief that grows out of times of war.Shawn Brommer, South Central Library System, Madison, WICopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile, Princess Anja has fled far away, and Mykkael has to flee for his own life, overtake her, enlist help for her, and finally lead her to safety through the monster-haunted terrain of Hell's Chasm. Once a marriage is arranged into a family of potent sorcerers, Anja can see about saving her realm and family, while Mykkael takes vengeance on the demons who, many years ago, drove him from his homeland and love. Wurts is skillful as ever at world-building and pacing, and her background as an artist shows in the kind of intensely visual writing that makes one wish more fantasy were written by artists.Roland GreenCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

One bundle is titledThings I Know Are Trueand the other,Things I Must Not Forget. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to \"ask her mother to tell her about her life. For once, she would ask. She would listen. She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do.\"Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion ofThe Bonesetter's Daughtertakes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting:I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds.Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlierThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Bonesetter's Daughter", "price": 6.83, "salesRank": {"Books": 1409075}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QpHx5Y4L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0143038109", "0143119087", "034546401X", "0062301675", "0142004898", "0143038095", "0399141146", "0062107313", "0385740352", "0689806167", "0802716830", "0399135782", "0804718156", "0143117645", "1451626657", "B002GJU418", "0679761640", "0155063863", "0399150749", "159463193X", "1554810272", "0062107321", "042524413X", "1565129768", "0307950395", "0812975227", "0520219783", "1455897213", "0812980549", "0679734775", "0802142443", "081299289X", "0399134204", "1400033411", "0812980352", "0812978684", "0156031515", "0679748261", "0061340405", "0451172027", "0684838230", "0449912701", "159448385X", "0385474547", "0618485228", "0486278077", "0385468865", "0156028352", "0809015803", "0486415872", "080411109X", "0811216020", "0812977610", "0385490445", "0807068977", "067976657X", "0802141900", "0027888304", "0689846177", "0679781587", "1493621890", "0345440315", "0679755330", "0451228146", "068484267X", "1442459964", "0143037749", "1400033438", "067976402X", "0060972459", "0375842209", "0812980530", "B0024FAOQ4", "0804194386", "0679721886", "0385721811", "0374529051", "0061950726", "0199552320", "0156033674", "B00817RYCG", "0544106539", "0573614636", "0156186004", "0061577073", "140003342X", "067973225X", "B00005JKGK", "0027888355", "080410753X", "0312119976", "B002CKYN8G", "159463176X", "0061730955", "0140186395", "0393960129", "1444123165", "0345522036", "0451530063", "0743270754"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0143038095", "0062301675", "0062107321", "0143119087"]}},

The killing temporarily stopped through the intervention of Hungary's regent, Admiral Miklos Horthy, under pressure brought by Raoul Wallenberg, a 31-year-old Swedish businessman from an aristocratic family. Wallenberg had been recruited by the War Refugee Board to attempt to intercede and save as many Jewish lives as possible. By bribing, hectoring and cajoling Hungarian officials Wallenberg managed to manufacture 4,500 Schutzpasses Swedish passports that allowed Jews, if they could prove any connection to Sweden no matter how dubious, to leave Hungary. He also negotiated a series of other deals with the Gestapo that made life easier for the Jews, even as the killings increased as the Russian Army advanced in early 1945. The final third of Smith's narrative examines the mystery of why Wallenberg was taken in custody by the Soviets in 1945 as a spy and was never heard from again. This familiar history is brought to life in vivid prose that at times borders on the imaginative was Wallenberg really inspired to his heroic actions after viewing the 1942 film Pimpernel Smith, based on the novel The Scarlet Pimpernel? and this important chapter of Holocaust history is conveyed with energy and a sound sense of historical context. Smith unearths no new material here although he does restate and reemphasize important historical facts such as the U.S. and British governments' negligence in not acting more quickly to save European Jewry but, in dramatic narrative form, presents a moving and compelling portrait of a man who acted when others did not.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Lost Hero: Raoul Wallenbergs Dramatic Quest to Save the Jews of Hungary", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5151XZGWBAL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 2929827}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Also serving as a gazetteer,  biographical dictionary (of the departed only), and tour guide  (covering, for instance, Edinburgh's 223 subarticles and  Dundee's 11), the work runs A to Z from music theorist and abbot  Aaron Scotus (d. 1052) to Zetland (an alternative name of  Shetland). The entries have been revised and updated throughout,  and over 100 new pieces have been added, including those on  former United Kingdom Prime Minister Douglas Home; revered,  liberal Labour leader John Smith, who would have had Blair's job  if not for heart failure; the devolved Scottish Parliament; and  cloned sheep Dolly. One four-page series of maps sketches  rivers, mountains, and major towns, while another shows current  administrative boundaries. Four appendixes present the  Presbyterian churches and schisms; the dynastic trees for the  royal houses of Canmore to Stewart; those of the royal houses of  Stewart to Hanover; and French monarchs to 1848, Scots monarchs  to the present, and English monarchs to 1707's Union with  England. Like all tools, this one has its failings. One problem  is that the Scottish Nationalists, the current Scots  Parliament's official Opposition, are the only political party  with an entry or index mention. The exclusion of the  long-prominent Scottish Labour, Liberal Democratic, and  Conservative parties reflects a serious bias, as all three have  played strong roles in Scottish governance since the 1707 Union.  The husband-and-wife editors, who work as writers and  broadcasters (John is also a historian of India), have produced  a fascinating book for research or browsing. Any general  library, and certainly those lacking the 1994 edition, will  welcome this standard reference, funds permitting. Highly  recommended.

{"asin": "0007111347", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"The thing about madness was, it just took so damn much energy, and it  was so thoroughly tedious in the meantime.\"  Master woodworker Rae Newborn knows madness intimately, with every bone, every pore, every particle of her being. At 52, with three suicide attempts, extended hospitalizations, the death of her husband and daughter, and a vicious attack behind her, Rae has come to Folly Island, far out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to rebuild her life by building a house:She would pull herself together, she would go and rebuild Desmond's house, she would lift his walls and dwell within them quietly all the rest of her days.  Everything that House was lay there waiting for her to take it up: House as shelter, House as permanence, House as a continuation and a legacy, comfort and challenge, safety and beauty, symbol and reality joined as one.Bequeathed to Rae by Desmond Newborn, a great-uncle she never met, Folly Island is lovely indeed.  But when Rae discovers Desmond's journal in the 70-year-old ruins of his house, she learns that Desmond had his own internal horrors to confront on the island.  As she labors in solitude, her prickly nature deterring all but the most determined of her would-be neighbors, it's not just her well-being that's at stake.  Rae must prove herself sane if she is to have any contact with her beloved granddaughter Petra. So when the \"skin-crawling feeling of being watched\" doesn't fade, she does her best to ignore it. But does paranoia have its roots in reality? And is Rae doomed to repeat her ancestor's tragic end?So effectively does King weave together past and present--the shrouded history of Desmond's life and death on Folly, and the tense, dusty, exhilaratingly panicky account of Rae's wrestling with old demons and new timber--that the future seems less important than the author might have wished.  In other words, the eventual unmasking of Rae's watcher pales in comparison to the gradual revelation of Rae herself within King's haunted and haunting narrative. But with such a strong character and such moodily lovely prose, readers shouldn't miss the denouement-driven trappings of standard suspense.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "Folly", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 5162376}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YATB2CJYL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0553382527", "0553586661", "0553574582", "0553578243", "0553574558", "0553578251", "0553588338", "0553573993", "0345531760", "0553588346", "0553386751", "0312427395", "055338676X", "0553383248", "0553386379", "0312427387", "1250055709", "0553381717", "0553590413", "055358667X", "0553807994", "0312427379", "0553386387", "B006QS0YQ0", "0345531787", "0553574566", "0553583417", "1250022061", "0312626908", "0312661681", "0553581058", "B0073FV7NY", "0312614160", "0425260453", "1250031125", "0312541163", "0062237195", "0553593617", "038534404X", "0553384805", "0553583387", "0062237187", "0312573502", "0345536746", "0385344023", "0553384791", "055357924X", "0312426216", "0143035304", "1250007348", "0062271601", "0062049615", "0061727717", "0061990639", "0547577400", "0553593625", "0061990647", "0345807154", "0312655479", "0547386060", "0312359675", "0547844174", "0062049585", "0345536738", "1476703558", "0316055433", "0553801910"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0553586661", "0312427379", "0553382527", "0553578251"]}},

{"asin": "0007116330", "description": "The argument of this set (see LJ 4/1/01 for a review of Volume  1) is that the two world wars were actually just one long war  with a confusing intermission and that the two parts of the  conflict have common themes, e.g., the problems of coalition  warfare, the experience of prisoners of war, and the shattering  experience of both wars, with increasing casualty rates and  strategic bombing really hitting hard on the Home Front. The  first volume focused on military affairs, while this follow-up  focuses on civilians and home fronts, the so-called People's  War. Thirty-five authors contributed 31 chapters about the  moral, cultural, and social experiences of the conflict,  covering topics such as British art and fiction, propaganda, the  Arab world, classical music, colonial India, and the  tribulations of German and Japanese women. Three chapters in the  last section discuss how this great world war is and should be  remembered, an issue that has been fought over quite a lot in  the last few decades. Excerpts from other works are used  liberally throughout. Each chapter is complemented by endnotes  and a short list of recommended readings, and the final chapter  is a bibliographic essay on the main sources used in studying  the wars. This set complements such histories as Earl R. Beck's  The European Home Fronts, 1939-1945 (H. Davidson, 1993).

A record of a classic road trip, Miller's tale is full of serendipitous adventures and thoughtful Christian reflection, offering an unusual mix of travel mishaps in a broken-down (and often breaking down) VW van; youthful, somewhat macho bantering between friends; and the sort of deep-thought wanderings into meaning and significance that are the meat of college-age existence. The book's strongest point is the way in which it conveys the character of Miller and his companion--two young \"Republican hippies.\" As we travel along with them, they can be fun, profound, annoying, hilarious and, at unguarded moments, surprisingly tender. Their insights are sometimes deep, sometimes naive, sometimes simple and sometimes just goofy. Their religious insights are similarly mixed in depth, but the two are remarkable and winsome in their aim at complete honesty. The narrator often allows himself to be portrayed in an unflattering light to faithfully recapture the experience. This book is an appealing Sunday afternoon read, a reminder that life is meant to be experienced and not just gotten through.

{"asin": "0007110642", "description": "Kindergarten-Grade 4-In true fairy-tale fashion replete with drama, romance, and redemption, a master storyteller conveys a timely (and timeless), compelling message about the frightening fragility of our environment, the awesome and restorative powers of nature, and the often-unconsidered consequences of an all-too-pervasive, superficial, \"gotta-have-it-now\" mentality. Lonely, unloved, and misunderstood, the gentle Beastman of Ballyloch lives alone on an island in his beloved silver lake, in harmony with the birds and animals, but reviled by the human inhabitants of the town, where he toils each day thatching houses, barns, and hayricks. As is so often the case in tales of this type, what lies beneath the sad young man's off-putting exterior is a person who is fine and untouched by anger or resentment. A brave and selfless act of kindness is the catalyst for a friendship, and this, coupled with his imposed intimacy with simple, natural elements, supplies the quiet Beastman with the information and intuition necessary to remedy an ecological upset that threatens the survival of all of Ballyloch. Foreman's pebbled watercolor-and-pencil pictures are jewel toned and as gentle and touching as the story itself, and their composition hints at the possibilities of reaching beyond boundaries-physical or figurative. This is an unassuming story with a powerful punch and a resonant reminder: \"There's truth in every fairy tale.\"-Kathy Krasniewicz, Perrot Library, Old Greenwich, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Years earlier, King Elrius usurped his sister's rightful claim to the throne--an act that abrogated the divine protections set over his people, bringing plague and war to the land. There are those who would see the divine prophecies honored, however, and a warrior queen restored to the throne. So Tobin is disguised by means of dark magic that conceals her true gender with that of her twin brother, who was killed at birth, but not fast enough. He drew a single breath, which was enough to keep his soul earthbound and horribly angry. Tobin will indeed be queen, but only if she can be protected until adulthood from her insane mother, her demonic brother, and every evil wizard in the land.

{"asin": "0007114494", "description": "Entering its centennial year, the Times Literary Supplement, that British bastion of highbrow book culture, has a circulation of just 35,000. So it should not surprise anyone if a 600-page, painstakingly thorough history of the supplement generates sales somewhat more meager than that. This is something of a shame, for despite its wrist-cracking bulk and geological pace, this volume is stylishly written, affectionate and more entertaining than it has any right to be. May, a TLS contributor and longtime Times man, closely chronicles the supplement's tenuous start (it was originally issued to cover book reviews squeezed out of the regular Times by parliamentary reports) and frequent financial crises the TLS would inevitably be rescued in the nick of time by one high-minded millionaire or another. May faithfully traces the rise of such famous contributors as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, freed by anonymity (there were no bylines in those days) to write searingly vivid critiques. (Of one unlucky title Woolf wrote, \"You draw from it that sense of instruction in unimportant matters which you get by looking from the train window at a flat stretch of countryside.\") May is equally good following the uncertain early fate of works destined for immortality, like The Waste Land and Ulysses. The correspondence of hawk-eyed TLS subscribers, pouncing on errors in translations of Catullus, will delight those with a taste for the absurd. It is hard to imagine any but the most stout-hearted TLS reader undertaking this long journey from cover to cover, but American literary scholars will likely treasure this heroic record of a periodical that took the life of the mind more seriously than most.

Steeped in girlfriend-to-girlfriend attitude and style, Horne's funky and relentlessly positive prose (\"[Eve] was, in fact, a benevolent and switched-on sister....\") is liable to infuriate practiced occultists while proving irresistible to young people fascinated by or even just curious about witchcraft. Part memoir and part manual, the book offers snapshots of just about every part of a modern witch's practice, from casting spells and observing Wiccan sabbaths to setting up an altar and practicing \"skyclad\" (or nude)Anot to mention how to make magic with, for and during sex. Although this guidebook can safely be characterized as a lighthearted romp through the practice of witchcraft, it does contain some useful and well-organized reference material, such as a glossary of \"magickal\" herbs, a calendar of the witch's year and a full complement of easy-to-follow spells for love, money and so forth. Occasionally, ethical qualms silence Horne's ready tongue, leading to curiously unusable directives (as in \"Bitchcraft,\" the chapter on hexing, where she describes in graphic detail the preparation and abuse of an enemy's effigy, but primly refuses to tell you what to say while you're doing it). Experienced Wiccans and occultists will want to turn to more authoritative sources, but as it stands, this is an appealing introduction for the dabbler, the dreamer and other wide-eyed seekers of modern-day magic.

Charting the entirety of England, this gigantic volume, substantial in both size and weight (ca. 20 lbs.), is issued in a sturdy, plastic carrying case with handle. Its format is most similar to U.S. county real estate atlases published by Real Estate Data, combining both aerial photography and cartography. Full-color aerial photos with amazing clarity and detail predominate, reproduced here in several scales: 1:72,000 (rural areas), 1:36,000, 1:18,000, and 1:4500 (urban areas). They are followed by 14 color, double-faced maps at a scale of 1:288,000 intended to orient the user by area. An index offers grid access by place name to both the aerial photographs and the maps. The maps themselves offer direct grid references to the aerial photographs.

Using a plot formula that has since become a mystery standard, Christie conveniently gathers all the characters in one hard-to-leave location, in this case, the Jolly Roger, a vacation hotel on the southern coast of England. One of the guests, a gorgeous, dramatic flirt, is strangled to death, and the famous detective Hercule Poirot who happens to be vacationing at the Jolly Roger, too sets out to solve the case. Each of the well-developed characters is suspect, and listeners will constantly be changing their bets as to whodunit. British stage actor Suchet, who many know as the definitive Poirot from the Public Television Mystery! series was an obvious choice for the reader of this production, having won an Audie award for reading Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1997. Suchet gives an outstanding and highly entertaining performance, obviously taking great zeal in the task of fleshing out Christie's colorful lot of characters.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Evil Under the Sun (Poirot)", "price": 6.64, "salesRank": {"Books": 2135091}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KV1rObouL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062073575", "006207377X", "006207394X", "0062074016", "0062073559", "0062073850", "0062073842", "0062073583", "0062073907", "0062073753", "0062073923", "0062074024", "0062074083", "0062073737", "0062073826", "0062073893", "0062073885", "0062073745", "0062073974", "0062073982", "0062073877", "0062073834", "0062073966", "0062073761", "0062074032", "0062073818", "0062073796", "0062073869", "1434404374", "0062074385", "0062073958", "0062073613", "0062073567", "0062074091", "0062073990", "006207380X", "0062074008", "0062073532", "006207363X", "0062074377", "0062094424", "0062073729", "0062074326", "0062074148", "0062073508", "0062073605", "0062073621", "0062073702", "0062073516", "0062074113", "0062073656", "0062073648", "0062073672", "0062074164", "0062073664", "0062073494", "0062073540", "0062073788", "0062074105", "0062073486", "1495950816", "0062094408", "0062073680", "0062074369", "0062094459", "0062073699", "0062074156", "0062073524", "0062074431", "0062074423", "0062094394", "0062073710", "0375851232", "006207413X", "0062074121", "0062073478", "0062074334", "1619493721", "0062094440", "0062074407", "0062251678", "0062074415", "B001KZOVJK", "0062094416", "0007121083", "0062074342", "0062094467", "B001KP2J44", "0425108589", "0062204572", "156478214X", "0486408787", "0486299287", "0030563518", "0440159229", "B005X5XI4C", "0152050787", "0312970072", "B005X5XINI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062073486", "0062073923", "0062074016", "0062073974"]}},

Her instructions are practical, too: if mace, cedar and nutmeg are hard to come by, burn lavender incense; if chanting \"skyclad\" (read: naked) doesn't appeal, wear a white flowing robe. This simplicity and pragmatism is especially important in light of Horne's personal theology, which with its elements of Hinduism, Greek mythology, astrology, Native American ritual and Hazelden self-help books is extremely ecumenical. Readers eager to explore the latest developments in self-improvement trends might find helpful mantras within and will likely be delighted by Horne's enthusiasm for her subject.

He recommends the old stalwarts regular exercise, eating a Mediterranean-style diet, not smoking and so on, but adds his own ideas as well. These not-so-obvious (and really quite fun) ideas include: enjoying regular sex, taking a three-week vacation every year, and getting a grip on one's emotional life. A German who resides in South Africa, Barnard also believes in herbs and mineral supplements as heart health boosters, supplements Americans have been slower to recognize. But while many of Barnard's tips may be helpful for everyone, the book is aimed primarily at men even though heart disease is a mjor killer of American women. For example, there's an entire chapter about male potency issues entitled, \"Take Viagra.\" Female sexual issues are addressed only peripherally. Likewise, there's a chapter on the benefits of drinking two glasses of red wine each day never mentioning recent findings linking alcohol with an increase in breast cancer in women.

Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassingThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King), and its charming precursor,The Hobbit. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Lord of the Rings", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2095945}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510DQ2D1RJL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["054792822X", "0618126988", "0345518845", "0345449762", "0345325818", "0867094478", "0618056998", "0544045521", "0821571133", "0073379220", "1586170252", "0393926168", "0618257608", "089870202X", "0345345061", "0345339681", "0060598247", "0544174224", "0345357116", "0786474785", "083083480X", "0618126996", "0312566743", "0393312836", "0393925722", "0544164229", "B00003CWT6", "0743234928", "0441172717", "0547928211", "0060652934", "B005LXQLRW", "0545162076", "0156904365", "B00005JKZY", "0137171668", "0312652690", "0375826696", "0544442784", "0061992887", "0547928203", "074323491X", "054792819X", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HFFE8HE", "0486415864", "0312369816", "B000MUJCDY", "0553801503", "0486289990", "B005537IFW", "0375842209", "B00HWWUQWQ", "0439784549", "0743273567", "B0088MVOUC", "0553582011", "1484707230", "B00005JKZV", "0142437301", "0345391802", "0545670314", "0987003984", "0765323117", "037584631X", "0553212753", "0446310786", "0142402516", "0316769487", "0441569595", "0345535529", "0440237688", "0807014273", "0062024035", "1495238954", "0743297334", "0590353403", "0060652950", "0439136369", "0140177396", "0679785892", "0440180295", "0345453743", "0345538986", "055358202X", "1451673310", "0812550706", "159463193X", "0140449264", "1451626657", "1423199626", "0441627404", "0553213458", "0156030306", "0684803356", "0060850523", "0743246268", "0451524934", "0399501487"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0345538374", "0547928211", "054792822X", "0547928203"]}},

But with calm, unadorned prose, smooth pacing and the genial realism of her modest colored-pencil drawings, Kerr makes Katerina more than the butt of a joke. Yearning for a companion to share life in the town's pond, Katerina believes that the reflection she sees in a shiny car is actually the other goose of the title: One day that goose will come out, thinks Katerina. Then I'll no longer be the only goose on the pond. But a snowfall that comes between Katerina and the reflection makes her think that her beloved has escaped! The sight of a man carrying a goose-sized thing in [a] goose-sized bag convinces Katerina that her soulmate is the victim of a goose-napping, and she single-mindedly pursues the perceived culprit. In the end, not only does justice prevail Katerina foils a bank robber but true love does, too: as a reward for her bravery, the town acquires a dashing gander named Charlie. The story gains from the English village setting (the mayor appears in a ceremonial robe) and from the supporting role awarded a girl shown admiring her own reflection on the car's surface, she is the only one who understands what Katerina really wants.

When a stranger enters the isolated mountain town of Viscos with the devil literally by his side, the widow Berta knows (because her deceased husband, with whom she communicates daily, tells her) that a battle for the town's souls has begun. The stranger, a former arms dealer, calls himself Carlos and proposes a wager to the town: if someone turns up murdered within a week, he'll give the town enough gold to make everyone wealthy. Carlos ensures people believe him by choosing the town bartender, the orphan Chantal Prym, as his instrument: he shows her where the gold is, confides that his wife and children have been executed by kidnapper terrorists (remember: 1992), and that he is hoping his belief that people are basically evil will be vindicated. Chantal would like nothing better than to disappear with the gold herself and thus faces her own dilemmas. Add in corrupt townspeople (including a priest), sometimes biting social commentary and, distastefully, a very heavily stereotyped recurring town legend about an Arab named Ahab, and you've got quite a little Garden of Eden potboiler. But the unsatisfying ending lets everyone off the hook and leaves questions hanging like ripe apples.(July 3)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge.

Widowed Ellie is just starting to recover from the recent death of her beloved if domineering husband, Frank. Returning to her village after a three-week stay at her daughter's in London, she learns that poison-pen letters pointing to scandal at St. Thomas's Rectory have led to the reassignment of her dear friend and vicar, the Reverend Gilbert Adams, and the emotional breakdown of the fey Nora, the church organist. Ellie agrees to help try to find out who's behind the letters. One evening, Ellie investigates a light in the church, a view nicely depicted on the novel's atmospheric dust jacket, and witnesses a \"suicide\" that she alone considers to be murder. Dismissed by the local police, Ellie puts her own life at risk to seek the truth. Our smart and determined heroine must also deal with her late husband's imperious aunt Drusilla; her spoiled, self-centered daughter, Diana; and a new man in her life, the suspiciously smooth Roy Bartrick (\"There's something too devil-may-care about him,\" asserts a neighbor). Minor characters introduced in the first book, like the inimitable Mrs. Dawes, take on new depth. Readers will cheer as Ellie takes charge after a lifetime of deferring to the wishes and wants of others. Anglophiles will relish the loving descriptions of those parts of London that make the great metropolis seem like a quaint village.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Murder by Suicide (Ellie Quicke Mystery Series #2)", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2729252}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HW97CJ5FL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1906288135", "0727862820", "190628833X", "072786145X", "0727873849", "1847512496", "0727864025", "0727865781", "0727891944"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1906288135"]}},

He  demonstrates how her concern with moral psychology and the  complexity of humans is better explored in her novels than in  her writing on existentialism. When first published in 1986 as  Iris Murdoch: The Saint and the Artist (Macmillan), Conradi's  was the first book-length study of Murdoch's fiction. It is here  reissued in a revised edition to accompany the publication of  Conradi's biography of Murdoch (LJ 9/1/01) and now joins fine  studies by Maria Antonaccio and Bran Nicol. Conradi reaffirms  his estimates of Murdoch's work while also taking into account  the novels she had subsequently published.

Readers are first introduced to the Dalai Lama as a young boy via brief but candid reflections on his mother, the loneliness his enthronement engendered and his rigorous study regimen. These and other intimate details of his life, including his meeting with President Mao and his exile to India, are telegraphed through an accessible and elegant first-person narration. The latter part of the text is dedicated to the Dalai Lama's philosophies on an assortment of topics, including religion (\"All religions share a common root, which is limitless compassion\"); anger (\"If your mind is dominated by anger, you will lose the greatest part of your human intelligence: wisdom\"); and marriage (\"making love is alright, but for marriage, don't hurry, be cautious\"). A novice-friendly glossary of Buddhist terminology and a stunning array of stand-alone, full-color photographs round out the volume. Though His Holiness solemnly admits that due to political and historical reasons he may very well be the last Dalai Lama, his teachings, illuminated in books such as this, will undoubtedly continue to influence generations of individuals seeking enlightenment.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Spirit of Peace: A Fully Illustrated Guide to Love and Compassion in Everyday Life", "price": 14.66, "salesRank": {"Books": 2540079}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X2H2HEML.jpg", "related": {"buy_after_viewing": ["1594488894"]}},

It also has - thank goodness - a welcome sense of humour and discernable characters rather than ciphers.' Victoria Moore, Daily Mail The Bronze Horseman 'Pulling off the passionate love story embedded in a truly epic narrative is a difficult thing to do. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind remains the blueprint for the genre, while Tolstoy's War and Peace carries off the literary honours ... it's quickly apparent that the Russian-born author Paullina Simons has the measure of this kind of epic romantic saga. The power of her descriptive writing, the vividness of the historical detail and, most of all, the strength of her central characters mark out her novel as a considerable achievement ... she is able to make some powerful statements about the durability of the human spirit, but never at the expense of descriptive passages refulgent with power and beauty' Barry Forshaw, amazon", "title": "Tatiana and Alexander", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 1319748}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bzksedPeL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061988227", "006185414X", "0062103237", "0062098136", "0006550576", "1582882320", "0006490018", "0007118937", "0425234231", "0060199261", "1622664485", "1476794944", "0425227642", "1476730946", "042521558X", "0061031127", "1476753164", "1497455049", "0312378025", "149539090X", "0312954212", "1401307477", "1492976423", "1622664493", "0805099239", "0805094601", "1401307469", "1619633612", "1582882657", "1497585368", "1423175123", "1476763933", "0142422010", "1476753180", "0312110839", "080509461X", "1619630346", "0062278819", "B0068EPTD0", "0142419400", "0385344430", "0425221644", "0803736991", "0062327968", "1482359006", "0983157200", "1250030951", "0805094598", "0399256938", "1619630621", "1442421770", "1477817158", "1622660757", "147674355X", "0765335344", "0374384673", "1476740518", "0451467973", "0553582798", "1423157516", "0006551114", "0805092668", "0312642970", "0062085549", "1476746559", "1598260219", "0440212561", "0425265080", "0385342578", "1491208295", "0802736106", "0062059998", "0061950726", "1481948997", "0062085573", "1442421800", "0062085611", "1423171020", "1622662644", "1482658143", "1423157370", "147781728X", "0452297540", "1402241372", "0553582771", "1491006919", "1477810250", "B00A3ZQ4UW", "0142426040", "0316213101", "1423178203", "0142422959", "1620610094", "0761463275", "1628780096", "1620610078", "1476756503", "1476783284", "0553578553", "0062085506"], "buy_after_viewing": ["006185414X", "0061988227", "0062098136", "014242417X"]}},

Unhappy that his younger brother is moving into his room, Billy Tibbles decides to find new quarters. His choices of the bathroom and the shed prove problematic, so he comes back inside just in time for a bedtime story. His sister refuses to allow him to sit on the couch, and they are both sent upstairs. Once there, Little Eric gives them a great idea for a communal activity: jumping on the mattress.

{"asin": "0007141785", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review.One of the great delights of reading a novel by the likes of Ghosh or Salman Rushdie is imagining their dialogue emerging in the mellifluous tones of the Indian-accented English spoken by their characters. In this audiobook, narrator Bamji accomplishes that task with skill, credibly rendering the lilting flavor of subcontinental English and reveling in the musicality of Ghosh's tale, set in a remote sector of India. Bamji invests most of his resources into the rich, ringing cadences of Kanai, the translator and intellectual at the heart of the book. Kanai, a striver looking to pull himself up by his bootstraps, possesses a certain comic charm, and Bamji embraces the role with panache. He also alternates smoothly between Kanai's dulcet tones and the flatness of Indian-American scientist Piyali, who encounters Kanai by chance when traveling to investigate Indian marine life. Ghosh's book evocatively imagines an India poised between past and present, and Bamji brings out the enormous range of voices clamoring for attention in this unfamiliar setting.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Everything you need to know about appreciating whisky, technically and culturally, is here. Read it and you won't need another whisky book in your life. Gordon Haggarty, The List magazine  In this swashbuckling book, Pip Hills lays bare all the secrets of whisky from its chemistry to its culture. He goes straight to the heart of the matter with admirable dispatch, revealing how the communion of barley, water, peat and oak creates a spirit of unique complexity.

The Pastons began as peasant farmers, rose to the status of minor Norfolk gentry and strove mightily to improve their lot through the courts, business and marriage. In this multigenerational biography, Castor tells their story as a sweeping whole and allows readers to understand these people's mental world, one so alien to us and yet strikingly familiar in the most unexpected of ways. Much of their story revolves around the acquisition of land and how they tried (not always successfully) to keep it out of the hands of their sometimes violent neighbors. Castor, a history fellow at Cambridge University, nicely summarizes the complexities of 15th-century politics and culture without losing her momentum. Beautifully paced and splendidly retold, Castor's tale of one family trying to survive and thrive against the odds is popular history at its best. 8 pages of color photos, 1 map.(Apr. 11)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The many schemes he concocts prove ineffective, and the sad child heads home along the beach. When he sees a sea star washed up on the sand, he is happy at last to have a star of his own.

The story opens with a brief account of the adventures of Parzival's father, a war-happy knight named Gahmuret who forsakes his new bride to go in search of conflict and glory, only to be killed in battle. From there, Clarke shifts to the son's tale, alternating accounts of Parzival's initial encounter with the Grail with the lusty meanderings of Gawain, a knight whose desire for romantic adventures is just as strong as his yearning for battle and recognition. Parzival's first encounter with the Grail throws his family into temporary disgrace and, when a witch curses him for his folly, he must go back and find the Grail a second time to square his accounts with the magic-oriented morality of the medieval world. Clarke, a scholar who provides a lengthy and thoughtful afterword to fill in the blanks for modern readers who are unfamiliar with Arthurian culture, certainly knows his material as well as his audience. But the nature of the story limits him to a wearisome alternation between battle scenes and love conquests, the one intriguing exception being Gawain's adventure in a house of horrors called Castle of Marvels that is controlled by an invisible evil magician named Kilgore. The craft and research that are obvious behind the writing will ensure Clark an audience among aficionados of medieval fiction, but there's nothing compelling enough in this particular retelling to earn him a wider audience.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Parzival and the Stone From Heaven: A Grail Romance Retold For Our Time", "price": 12.45, "salesRank": {"Books": 1034772}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CKV3K6S1L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0140443614", "1846881145", "190699935X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0140443614", "1846881145", "0330324594"]}},

As they sail up the river to Kit's new home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still, her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns, and talks back to her elders is not only headstrong, she is in grave danger of being regarded as a witch. When Kit befriends an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, it is more than the ascetics can take: soon Kit is defending her life.

Although Mog dies on the first page (\"Mog was tired. She was dead tired.- Mog thought, `I want to sleep for ever.' And so she did\"), the cat stays around for the duration of the story in the form of a spirit, thinking that the family won't be able to get along without her. The family members are sad at first, but their attention is soon taken up with a new kitten that is afraid of everything. With the help of Mog, it learns to play like a proper cat, and to love its family and be loved in return. Satisfied that her former family is now in good cat paws, Mog's spirit flies up to the sky. Like so many other classic children's book characters, this feline seems frozen in time, cared for by children who never get any older and in a house that always appears the same, providing readers the comfort that accompanies familiarity. But young listeners who know Mog may feel as bereft as her fictional family, and the uninitiated may be taken aback by the abrupt death. The floating spirit in each of the color cartoon illustrations may elicit questions that require some thoughtful adult answers. Although this is an interesting exploration of loss, endings, and new beginnings, for Mog's loyal fans, saying good-bye to her is like killing off Clifford, the big red dog.Jane Marino, Scarsdale Public Library, NYCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Goodbye Mog", "price": 8.8, "salesRank": {"Books": 2223693}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RDFRX7Q0L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["000717134X", "0007171285", "076364563X", "0007171366", "0007117523", "0590100548", "0688115187", "0007193602", "0764117645", "0689871341", "0007171331", "0001360000", "1783440295", "0007171315", "0006640338", "0943432898", "0517572656", "B006CDNWPE", "155017584X", "1553377648", "0976472481", "0875167349", "0590417010", "0007347049", "0007347030", "B005Q6A9CC", "0007528086", "0007167059"], "buy_after_viewing": ["000717134X", "076364563X", "0007171285", "0007171331"]}},

After a feud with a neighboring warlord results in the bloody deaths of his cherished wife and children, MacLennan sets in motion his plans for a huge fortress, complete with dungeon, and then decamps to the fabled land of China in search of adventure. Working as a hired fighter, MacLennan encounters young Mudan (Peony) and, on impulse, buys her as his tea slave. The child's presence begins to reawaken feelings of tenderness in MacLennan, which he does his best to squelch. In another, more conventional novel, this softening might be the start of the warrior's re-entry into the world of the loving; here, it is simply the beginning of a heart-wrenching struggle between compassion and vengeance. For her part, Peony takes scraps of happiness where she can, gleaning wisdom and courage from the teachings of the Buddhist soldier with whom MacLennan travels; some years later, when she accompanies MacLennan back to Scotland, she finds something like familial love in her friendship with a kind stable boy. As the novel moves toward its conclusion, it conveys a powerful message about the terrible price of unswerving revenge. A poignant epilogue offers a spark of hope, especially welcome after all the sorrow that precedes it.

{"asin": "0007152531", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A romance evolves in the wake of a domestic shooting in Kimmel's intelligent and compassionate debut novel, which brings two friends of one of the victims together in a small Indiana town. Amos Townsend is the male protagonist, a 40-ish preacher who counseled the late Alice Baker-Maloney as her frayed marriage degenerated into a fatal confrontation with her controlling husband, Jack. Amos remains tormented by his attraction to Alice and his inability to have prevented the tragedy. Meanwhile, bookish Langston Braverman has returned home after dropping out of her Ph.D. program following an affair with an academic colleague and subsequent nervous breakdown. The two clash after Langston's mother, AnnaLee, orders her to abandon her literary projects to care for Alice's two orphaned daughters; Amos accuses Langston of being unfit for the job when both girls continue to exhibit a bizarre variety of compulsive, religiously oriented behaviors. The girls' crisis continues to escalate, leading to a series of melodramatic scenes in which Amos and Langston are forced to confront their own demons. There are some winning moments as the protagonists move toward a romance, although things are hindered somewhat by the sluggish pace in the early going, as Kimmel (A Girl Named Zippy) meanders through scenes detailing smalltown Midwestern life and as she delves into the pasts of the two leads. Still, she proves a wise, compassionate and often very witty storyteller whose affection for her characters is contagious.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Solace of Leaving Early", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 5040199}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VHE8J6P9L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767915054", "074328500X", "0743247795", "0743247779", "B003E7EV88", "0743247787", "1619020653", "0385499825", "0743247752", "0689874030", "1616200154", "061815955X", "0312424094", "0385721676", "0399162097", "0385720963", "0812983459", "0449911608", "0061950726", "1416572848", "0670024783", "0316098329", "0374526788", "1594488398", "0061928178", "0345525558", "1605296767"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767915054", "074328500X", "B003E7EV1K", "B003E7EV88"]}},

It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007156588", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In his lively history,Evening in the Palace of Reason, James R. Gaines sets two remarkable--and remarkably different--historical figures on a collision course toward a single night in Potsdam in 1747: the composer Johann Sebastian Bach--\"old Bach,\" as he was called then at the age of 62--and the still-young Prussian king, Frederick II, already known as Frederick the Great after less than a decade on the throne. Having long employed old Bach's son Carl--a more celebrated composer at the time--Frederick summoned the father from Leipzig and challenged him, with an offhanded cruelty, to a public compositional puzzle designed to humiliate the great wizard of the waning art of counterpoint.Gaines is a pleasant guide through the incestuous patchwork monarchies of middle Europe, with a breezy tone fitting for a former editor ofPeople. (\"The Hohenzollerns were a funny bunch,\" he writes at one point.) But he is also a passionately learned student of the intricacies of the era's musical theories and the secret languages of its coded compositions. (One is thankful that he and his publisher resisted calling the bookThe Bach Code.) Gaines leads up to his pivotal encounter with a double biography of his two principals, told in alternating chapters. Bach's mostly homebound life, which left few documents for historians, is often no match for the grotesque dramas of Frederick's parallel story, which climaxes when his father the king forces Frederick to witness the execution of his best friend (and perhaps lover). The weight that keeps the two stories in balance is the genius of Bach's work, particularly the masterfulMusical Offeringthat he composes in response to the king's challenge. The encounter itself may not bear the full burden that Gaines wants to give it, as a clash between two epochal worldviews, the faith of the Reformation versus the rationalism of the Enlightenment, but the two life stories he so vividly describes make the journey there more than worthwhile.--Tom Nissley", "title": "Evening in the Palace of Reason", "price": 9.71, "salesRank": {"Books": 441278}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XBMB5C3NL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0375415297", "0007156618", "B00004Z1B6", "1597522775", "0393319563", "156563361X", "039304825X", "1591280109", "0800607929"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007156618"]}},

In this powerful, intimate story, journalist Smith sets out to find these men and discover how that experience changed their lives. Smith, a boy living in a nondescript California subdivision at the time of the Apollo missions and caught up in the endless possibility of space flight, journeys to the halls of power in Washington, D.C., and the backwoods of Texas in search of these mythical figures of American know-how. He finds Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon, still cool and confident, a plainspoken man who never let on how close that mission came to disaster. In Gene Cernan, the last man on the Moon, he finds an imperious, driven, highly successful businessman. If all of the men share one affliction, it's fame. Once at the center of the world's attention, these mostly ordinary men with some extraordinary gifts and luck have lived their lives being asked the same question&mdash;What was it like \"up there\"? In an artful blend of memoir and popular history, Smith makes flesh-and-blood people out of icons and reveals the tenderness of his own heart.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007157738", "description": "Black comedy meets social satire meets British farce in this winning novel by the author of Man Kills Woman, which shows how one man's generosity can become the source of another man's insanity. Phillip, an ex-football (as in soccer) star and a vaguely hapless instruction manual writer, is best friends with couple Barry and Sean, who are so rich and nice that they shower Phillip and his family with lavish gifts-skiing vacations, rare Chinese carvings and priceless Venetian corkscrews. With each new present he receives, Phillip becomes more obsessed with finding the perfect return gift. Repeated failures leave him so overwhelmed by gift inadequacy (\"I had lost. I had been defeated utterly... I was the inferior man\") that his attempts at reciprocation begin to look more like revenge. A sketchy fellow named Carlo-whom Phillip meets in jail after a dinner party gone awry-feeds Phillip's anxieties, and soon Phillip is sneaking into Barry and Sean's home in the middle of the night to perform a \"creepy-crawly\": shifting around their personal possessions and inadvertently killing one of the chinchilla rabbits he'd given them as a gift. Flusfeder's delightfully spare prose makes room, too, for the search for cult hero and erstwhile Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett, with whom Barry is obsessed; movie world excesses, displayed by Barry and Sean's fancy friends; parenting anxiety; and lots of Taoist sex-though why Phillip's wife, Alice, remains eternally willing despite his near-psychosis is a bit of a mystery.

{"asin": "0007156634", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The son of a German mother and an Irish father, Hugo Hamilton grew up in Dublin in the 1950s wearing \"lederhosen and Aran sweaters, smelling of rough wool and new leather, Irish on top and German below.\" His family spoke both German and Irish, but English was strictly forbidden--even uttering a few words of the cursed language was enough to earn an often brutal punishment from their father, a staunch Irish nationalist. His father maintained that \"your home is your language\" and insisted that they be a model Irish family and an example for others to follow. Hamilton and his siblings were not even permitted to play with children who did not speak Irish exclusively--a particular problem in a country where English is the primary language. Ironically, he was taunted mercilessly for his German heritage and children jeered him with cries of \"Eichmann\" and \"Heil Hitler.\" He was even put on \"trial\" once by a gang of kids who sentenced him death by snowball firing squad. This confusing quest to discover his identity and to gain an understanding of his family history is at the heart ofThe Speckled People, a profoundly touching and beautifully written memoir.His parents' secrecy concerning their own pasts only exacerbated his frustration, forcing Hamilton to cling to fragments of information gleaned secretly from hidden photographs and buried family relics. Written from the perspective of a child, Hamilton captures his feelings of confusion, guilt, and fear convincingly and with much humor and insight. Full of poetic passages, sharp observations, and the kind of subtle epiphanies that are best expressed by a child, the book is a joy to read. \"When you're small you know nothing and when you grow up there are things you don't want to know,\" he writes. This memoir is Hamilton's attempt to reconcile the two.--Shawn Carkonen--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Speckled People: A Memoir of a Half-Irish Childhood", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 301088}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Zp3Z7LU8L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0307396185", "1844083160", "006207105X", "1400034302", "0393338002", "0385312377", "0486268705", "0670025305", "0816669864", "0547904142", "1933372966", "0545224918", "0847691497", "1416949208", "0802170390", "0143035746", "0143035096", "0140092552", "0062026097", "1400079861", "0547840128", "014241980X", "0618593942", "0679727523", "055359012X", "0156007754", "0140044469", "1555976522", "0375700234", "031242227X", "0807002178", "0316014990", "1851686002", "1439148953", "0312273185", "1400097029", "0393326918", "0486280500", "068484267X", "0571241212", "1888463198", "0743257928", "0822223058", "0674463641", "0816520356", "0803239262"], "bought_together": ["0307396185"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0307396185", "081297932X", "1416549013", "1439189749"]}},

Taking a ball of string to leave as a trail, he sets off with his squirrel friend, unaware that his other animal pals plan to surprise him by getting to the center first. Percy takes so long to complete his tasks, however, that the creatures fall asleep on a lion-shaped bench, and Percy plays a trick on them instead. It turns out that the joke is on all of them, though?the well-meaning squirrel has collected all the string, and they will have a difficult time finding their way out. The poem that preceeds the story foreshadows such a dilemma, and at the conclusion, readers are invited to help by choosing the right path on the large, fold-out maze attached to the back of the book. (It will be disappointing, of course, if previous readers have navigated their way out with crayon or pencil.) Butterworth's bright, watercolor cartoons depict mischievous, fun-loving animals set for a springtime caper.

Beyond those facts, historical opinion varies--some scholars regard him as a reformer, and others as a reactionary, a debate that inspirits Michael Turner'sPittthe Younger (2003). Hague's biography differs from Turner's by muting interpretive issues and amplifying the day-to-day events in a life permeated by politics. Pitt's personal life remains enigmatic, and Hague acknowledges Pitt's elusiveness even as he attempts to ascertain whether he was an alcoholic or a homosexual. More certain is Pitt's ability as a leader and orator of the House of Commons, an institution the author himself knows well; he was the Conservative Party's former debating antagonist of Labour leader Tony Blair. Hague's experience adds convincing power to his account of Pitt's career, explaining how he remained ascendant for so long. A thorough biography, Hague's work is also an able contribution to British parliamentary history.Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"asin": "0007154607", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Authors who write about the entertainment industry often extend promises of wit and edginess to attract an audience.Colors Insulting to Nature, bySaloncolumnist Cintra Wilson, delivers these qualities because it enters the fray not with a forgettably likeable protagonist predestined for a happy ending, but with an axe to grind. The object of Wilson's loathing is the \"ego-porn\" Hollywood that turns out formulaic story lines, making hapless, mediocre talents believe that their dreams of fame can somehow come true.The central mediocre talent in this book is Liza Normal, who first appears in the story as an adolescent auditioning for a spot in a commercial. Imagine the child version of the Bette Midler character inBeachesand you're about halfway to understanding the tragic gaudiness of Liza's persona--though of course she is a sweet girl underneath it all. The novel follows Liza into adulthood, bringing other vividly drawn characters, including her shut-in brother, Ned, her narcissistic, alcoholic mother, Peppy, and a sadomasochistic dwarf named DelVonn along for the ride. Liza's cringingly funny attempts to win fame as an actress-singer never stop--and neither does Wilson's railing against the logic-corrupting, \"ultimately demoralizing\" messages from film and television that Liza has ingested from infancy. Will our heroine ever turn her life around and figure out that The Media made her do it? Will Wilson succeed in breaking free of formulas, or end up undercutting her own message with a fairy-tale ending?

{"asin": "0007155395", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In classic psychoanalytic style, Phillips strips our lives down to the fundamentals to illustrate the delicate balance between sanity and insanity. Sanity, he notes, \"has never been a popular word, or indeed... a condition one might write a book about.\" Madness, on the other hand, is dramatic and all too visible. We have psychiatrists, neurologists and researchers dedicated to studying and treating madness, but not even a quantifiable definition of saneness. Deftly guiding readers through historical and literary uses of \"sane\" and \"mad,\" Phillips, a British psychoanalyst (On Flirtation), cites Thomas Carlyle, R.D. Laing, Melanie Klein, D.W. Winnicott and Richard Dawkins, among others, to illustrate the stark absence of a definitive definition of sanity. InHamlet, for instance, Polonius uses the word \"madness\" to describe Hamlet's inventiveness and eloquent intelligence: he admires Hamlet's madness. Phillips examines the presence and essence of madness in all aspects of modern life in intriguing and disturbingly frank chapters on the chaos of raising children, the turmoil of adolescence, sexual appetites and the pursuit of wealth. His arguments, both thought provoking and provocative, may affect future definitions of sanity and madness, and readers are left with a fresh awareness of what it really means to be sane.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Holman entered the navy at age 12, at the height of the Napoleonic Wars. When blindness overcame him, Holman was an accomplished sailor, and he engineered to join the Naval Knights of Windsor, a quirky group who only had to live in quarters near Windsor Castle and attend mass for their stipend. For many blind people at the time, this would have been the start of a long (if safe) march to the grave. Holman would have none of it and spent the bulk of his life arranging leaves of absence from the Knights in order to wander the world (without assistance) from Paris to Canton; study medicine at the University of Edinburgh; hunt slavers off the coast of Africa; get arrested by one of the czar's elite bodyguards in Siberia; and publish several bestselling travel memoirs.

Threaded into her family's crisis is her ongoing internal elegy on the exclusion of women from the literary canon, which she transposes to mean her daughter's exclusion from humanity. Reta wonders if her daughter has discovered, as she herself did years before, that the world is \"an endless series of obstacles, an alignment of locked doors,\" and has chosen to pursue the one thing that doesn't require power or a voice: goodness.In her own writing, Reta reaffirms her own sense of self, as well as her sense of humor. As her theoretical reflections on modern womanhood play counterpoint to her unwavering sense of creating a home and keeping her family together, Reta's smarts and fears form a wonderfully coherent narrative--a life worth reading about.

Still, he is unable to avoid the eternal question of \"what if?\" His mind wanders off medicare and HMOs, drifting back to his high school years, yearning for another chance to correct his juvenile mistakes, to chart a different course in life. Change, however, is thrust upon him when Sam, his lover of 15 years, leaves him for a younger man. Lingeman's world implodes, and he is thrown back into the scene of Washington's gay bars, seeking reaffirmation and companionship. His sudden change of status propels him into an obsession with one of his boyhood fantasies, a model in an ad he saw in a magazine as a child. Lingeman is so engrossed by this ephemeral man that he misses a more obvious and tangible potential lover. Cleverly, Lingeman's career echoes his romantic life, as he finds himself disgusted with the opportunism and cynicism of Washington politics. Merlis's staccato style, stinging and insightful, puts the reader inside Lingeman's head as he treads the fine line between fantasy and reality, between the superficial and the meaningful. Merlis is able to move from describing a certain assistant's dress as one \"an organ grinder might have chosen for his monkey\" to the deepest contemplations of commitment, couplehood and the importance of candor. He creates a protagonist with broad appeal, proving beyond doubt that the personal is political and vice versa.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Man About Town: A Novel", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 2836757}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4101Tfu0inL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312242883", "0395689929", "1596910429", "0312186754", "0062196243", "155152502X", "1593501188", "0394751019", "0743272714", "1608209121", "0312303726", "1608197034", "1609530896", "1620401886", "0312263031", "1608208400", "0964109964", "0446563137", "0299283402", "1608207064", "B007IV4ODS", "1590211618", "0802139027"], "bought_together": ["0394751019"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0395689929", "0312186754"]}},

Percy the park keeper spends his day off relaxing with his animal friends. The first illustration depicts the man lounging against an old tree trunk, chewing on a long stem of grass; his anthropomorphized friends recline in identical positions. Everything is fine until a jumping game gets out of hand and a young rabbit falls into an abandoned well. Percy rushes to help, throwing her a long rope and instructing her to tie it tight. Not understanding what she is supposed to do, she ties it to the log she's sitting on and proceeds to find her own way out. The man and his helpers strain and pull until finally out pops the log-but no bunny. The following page folds out and out again, revealing a long line of befuddled animals-and a little rabbit holding onto the end. This fold-out page is clever but will not hold up well in a library.

Instead, he sold his airplane ticket for $100 and went to score crack in the slums of Nashville, beginning what Earle calls his four-year \"vacation in the ghetto.\" It's a brilliant opening hook, and St. John (Walkin' After Midnight) never lets the reader go, breezily guiding through Earle's wild childhood (he dropped out of school after the eighth grade and was living on his own by 16), his five tumultuous marriages, his many run-ins with the law, his restless wanderings through the American South and Mexico-and a quarter-century of addiction to booze, cocaine and heroin that finally ended after some jail time in the mid-1990s. By talking to many of Earle's closest friends, family and former wives, St. John manages to demythologize a man whose life often threatens to overshadow his music (unfortunately, however, she herself doesn't spend much time on Earle's actual recordings). She interprets Earle's death wish simply as an attempt to break away from his middle-class upbringing. Like his literary heroes Hemingway and Kerouac, he courts disaster to fuel his writing. As St. John writes, \"It was no accident that his life was a series of belief-beggaring dramas; quite often he was the cause of them. Consciously or unconsciously, he cultivated his own legend.\" Springsteen may have been the \"consummate chronicler of welfare-line blues,\" she writes, \"but Steve had lived the life.\"Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Hardcore Troubadour: The Life and Near Death of Steve Earle", "price": 13.06, "salesRank": {"Books": 444197}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41p0JzOJahL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0547754434", "B00B89WZCS", "0879308427", "B000002N61", "0618040269", "B001QZEHEI", "B004N5DHSK", "B000002NIC", "B00005V7G1", "0769284493", "B000006YE9", "0618219242", "B00064VQYE", "0618820965", "B00006IUH6", "B000000EXP", "B00000I427", "B0013UL4EC", "0816519064"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009D76K00", "B000006YE9", "B000002NIC", "B00817OTPG"]}},
{"asin": "0007161328", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Billed as a novel of \"overlapping relationships,\" Whitbread-winner Cusk's evocative latest, with its tenuously connected sections, feels more like a short story collection linked by theme and a few shared characters. Cusk (The Country Life; Saving Agnes) unites her tales via her characters' lonely, isolated conditions and the knotty relationships between parents and children&#x97;from Kristy, an imprisoned mother-to-be who gives birth in the back of a squad car in \"Confinement,\" to Mrs. Daley, an unhappy, controlling woman whose need to establish herself as a victim trumps her ability to find or give happiness in \"Mrs Daley's Daughter.\" Cusk's vision of contemporary relationships is a lonely, wintry one, in which people's inner landscapes dominate. This makes for gorgeous, languorous writing in places, but it also restricts the view: the landscapes are so rich with pathos that there isn't always enough room for the range of human emotion so essential to prose that relies on thought instead of action. In \"The Sacrifices,\" a married woman who never had the baby she desired visits her childhood home, now occupied by strangers, and fantasizes about returning to her old room: \"I would sit on my bed as the afternoon turned outside the window to night. I would wait for them to call me down.\" This passivity runs throughout the book, as characters tend toward rumination rather than deed. But as readers come to the end, the lives of Cusk's characters begin to tie together hauntingly. This is not life in all its messy complexity, but a mannered, poignant portrait of the treacheries of domestic life.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007163665", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this nervy, self-conscious debut novel, British writer Thirlwell airs the unspoken anxieties and confusions of two lovers, crafting a talky deconstruction of a relationship. Moshe is a character actor, \"the sketchy one, the sardonic one, the oddball cool\"; Nana is an architecture student, \"tall, thin, pale, blonde, breasty.\" It is the off-stage narrator, however, who is the book's most notable presence, with his countless digressions, \"simple\" theories, lengthy explanations and bossy directives. Despite his repeated assertions that the book is not about sex (\"sex isn't everything\"; \"sometimes I think that this book is an attack on sex\"), Moshe and Nana are constantly experimenting (\"oral sex, use of alternative personae, lesbianism, undinism\"), though their experiments usually end in failure. This is true of their biggest experiment, a three-way affair involving Anjali, an Anglo-Indian actor friend of Moshe's. Reading Thirlwell's novel is similar to watching a film with the director in the room, guiding the viewer through every scene. While many of the resulting narrative flourishes are clever or endearing, their humor and intellectual cachet wear thin as the ratio of window dressing to substance tips heavily in favor of the former. Still, Thirlwell's brave attempt to debunk the primacy of sex (while elaborately describing his characters' hapless pursuit of it) is surprisingly convincing.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Politics: A Novel", "price": 7.59, "salesRank": {"Books": 2979350}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61qBNiOp1dL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0956569234", "B005Q6BMTQ", "0670015970", "0099513226", "0374137226"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0956569234"]}},

{"asin": "0007163061", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "British historian and Emmy Award-winning BBC producer Cadbury (The Last King of France, etc.) chronicles seven great engineering feats of the 19th and early 20th centuries: the Great Eastern, the largest ocean-going vessel of the mid-19th century; the London sewer system; the U.S. transcontinental railroad; the Brooklyn Bridge; the Panama Canal; the Hoover Dam; and, least known, Scotland's Bell Rock Lighthouse. Cadbury pays special attention to the visionary, sometimes almost delusional men who were the human catalysts for these breakthrough accomplishments. Her choices are good ones, as the fascinating personalities at the center of these endeavors include corrupt manipulators, selfless crusaders and arrogant self-promoters, all of whom share a preternatural single-mindedness, which is at the core of their successes. Cadbury also describes the human costs that success required, often of the founders of these enterprises and invariably of those who moved the steel, dug the holes and poured the concrete. The cumulative loss of lives on these projects was in the thousands, and Cadbury is unsparing in her descriptions of the ways death occurred. Men were boiled alive in a boiler malfunction on the Great Eastern; blown up, scalped or mutilated while working on the transcontinental railroad; and entombed in concrete while building Hoover Dam. But the book is not a social commentary about the reckless disregard of 19th-century industrialists; it is, rather, dedicated to the human ingenuity displayed in these battles with a stubborn and capricious natural world. Readers who enjoyed the challenge of building the 1893 World's Fair in The Devil and the White City will find much to revel in here.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Road it's: never pass a part of the world with your name in or on it. Thus this genealogist-cum-pint-swilling adventurer embarks on a frolicsome, drunken globe-trot to uncover the roots of all things McCarthy and in the process expose what it means to be a McCarthy and, by extension, to be Irish. It's a lively, lusty quest; McCarthy travels like a Renaissance explorer with a film director's lens. In Tangiers, he finds a Moroccan McCarthy who puts a unique spin on the term \"black Irish.\" He takes in America's premier Irish event, New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade (which he finds more Celtic and American than Irish and not a little Scottish besides). Next stop: Tasmania, the penal colony where so many Irish were sent by the British government. And how could he resist a visit to the town of McCarthy, Alaska, population 18? The ultimate mocking tour guide with acerbic charm, McCarthy delivers scathing critiques of people and places, himself included. His droll and often drunken existentialist view proffers a unique (and distinctly Irish) perspective on the world that is part history, part McCarthy's Law. Some may be put off by his frequent references to drugs, sex and overimbibing, but McCarthy is like a character out of contemporary Irish literature, a traveler on a winding road surrounded by life's imperfections yet finding them beautiful despite it all (especially after a pint or two).

The heroine is thirtysomething Cath, a smiling, punning, do-goodingbien pensantwho has somehow ended up in the vicious purlieus of Wall Street, dealing billions with the great white sharks of high finance. This unfeasibly high-powered employ contrasts sharply with Cath's home life. She's married to a man 25 years her senior: \"sweet Bailey, dearest Bailey... optimistic where I was pessimistic, enthusiastic where I was distrustful.\" This marriage is not perfect: as Cath mordantly observes, \"marriage is awful in its nearness. Yoked together, bound, in a three-legged race with no finishing line.\" Nevertheless Cath and Bailey, in their May/December way, have found a kind of happiness. Then, horribly, Bailey is diagnosed with Alzheimer's....Three chapters in we learn this terrible truth, and the rest of the book concerns Cath's desperate, affecting, sardonic, resolute ways and means of dealing with Bailey's rollercoaster ride to the inevitable--or even worse. It's not an easy journey; this is not the easiest of books.

This volume, with an introduction and commentary by Wilde's grandson, Holland, publishes for the first time the unabridged transcript of the first of the three infamous trials that resulted in Wilde's destruction. The irony, as Holland's introduction makes abundantly clear, is that Wilde courted his imprisonment, suing his inamorata's father, the Marquess Queensberry, John Douglass, for libel when Queensberry left a card for him at the Albemarle Club that read, \"For Oscar Wilde, posing sodomite.\" Wilde might have been best served by tearing up the card and forgetting it; instead, he pressed charges. But Wilde's riskiest step was treating the witness stand as a theatrical stage. When a prosecutor asked him if he had kissed a certain young man, Wilde joked, \"Oh no, never in my life. He was a peculiarly plain boy.\" With that one flippant comment, Holland's text suggests, the die was cast. But the transcript and Holland's judicious notes also reveal how ill-served Wilde was by his counsel. Some of the same letters that were later used to convict Wilde were introduced by his own lawyers in this first trial as evidence. The general reader might find a work that condenses all three trial transcripts into one narrative, such as Moises Kaufman's stage adaptation, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, more accessible, but this volume is invaluable for the Wilde enthusiast, the legal scholar, the champion of human rights and the student of English literature.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde: The First Uncensored Transcript of The Trial of Oscar Wilde vs. John Douglas (Marquess of Queensberry), 1895", "price": 12.58, "salesRank": {"Books": 1077361}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kn7-WiabL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["080505894X", "0394554841", "0465044387", "0375702326", "0805059156", "0300173806", "1605983810"], "buy_after_viewing": ["080505894X", "0486401464", "0394759842", "0786707011"]}},

{"asin": "0007162219", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A baffling array of science books claim to reveal how the mysteries of the universe have been discovered, but Simon Singh'sBig Bangactually delivers on that promise. General readers will find it to be among the very best books dealing with cosmology, because Singh follows the same plan he used in his brilliantCode Book: he puts people--not equations--first in the story. By linking the progression of the Big Bang theory with the scientists who built it up bit by bit, Singh also uncovers an important truth about how such ideas grow.Death is an essential element in the progress of science, since it takes care of conservative scientists of a previous generation reluctant to let go of an old, fallacious theory and embrace a new and accurate one.As harsh as this statement seems, even Einstein defended an outmoded idea about the universe when an unknown interloper published equations challenging the great man. Einstein didn't have to die for cosmology to move forward (he reluctantly apologized for being wrong), but stories like this one show how difficult it can sometimes be for new theories to take root. Fred Hoyle, who coined the term \"big bang\" as a way to ridicule the idea of a universe expanding from some tiny origin point, strongly believed that the cosmos was in a steady state. But Singh shows how Hoyle's research, meant to prove the contrary, added evidence to the expansion model.Big Bangis also a history of astronomical observation, describing the development of new telescopes that were crucial to the development of cosmology.

Whether one is in harmony with the world or not depends upon one's relative emotional and spiritual health. For this reason, the core teachings of Buddhism have always emphasized various forms of mind training. InTransforming the Mind, based on an edited series of his lectures, the Dalai Lama provides a succinct overview of the basic techniques of spiritual development in Tibetan Buddhism. He introduces several aspects of mind training, combining the insights of traditional scholarship with his personal warmth and humanity.The book begins with a lucid account of the basic teachings of Buddhism--the nature of the human predicament and how it can be overcome. Then two key aspects of mind training involving the development of altruism and insight are described. This is essential, since Buddhism teaches that true mental transformation requires a sense of responsibility for others, together with the attainment of insight into the dynamic working of the human psyche and the world. Included in the book is the short traditional text on mental transformation, which the Dalai Lama used to structure his illuminating presentation of Buddhist practice. As an added bonus, the book concludes with a message for the millennium, giving the Dalai Lama's views on the role of Buddhist-inspired ethics in this newly dawning era.Though not aimed at complete beginners, this book will appeal to readers who are seriously committed to bringing about change in the world through developing their own spiritual capabilities, whether they are Buddhists or not.--Stephen Hodge, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Transforming the Mind: Teachings on Generating Compassion", "price": 14.66, "salesRank": {"Books": 1327561}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P8B9MHT2L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1594488894", "0743453360", "1571746099", "0743290461", "1401931847", "1559391979", "0316930938", "1573228834", "1559390735", "B00B1KZRJ2", "0805090215", "0743463021", "072253955X", "1594480923", "1594487383", "1559392401", "1590306937", "0140196129", "1559391537", "0767920813", "161429156X", "014219607X", "1608829928", "0553381059", "0007100973", "0307407802", "1571746285", "1559392592", "0861711734", "0007332475", "0060987014", "1559390611", "1416565841", "1559392533", "0767903692", "1594487898", "1559390328", "0062018094", "0861716280", "1571746811", "155939403X", "0722532105", "0060616881", "1466480033", "1559392282", "0060617225", "0861714407", "0861711823", "0062508342", "1401940587", "0500289611", "0861711238", "0062267434", "0553351397"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1594488894", "0743453360", "1416565841", "1571746099"]}},

{"asin": "0007163649", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. The cycle of photosynthesis is the cycle of life, says science journalist Morton (Mapping Mars). Green leaves trap sunlight and use it to absorb carbon dioxide from the air and emit life-giving oxygen in its place. Indeed, plants likely created Earth's life-friendly oxygen- and nitrogen-rich biosphere. In the first part, Morton, chief news and features editor of the leading science journal,Nature, traces scientists' quest to understand how photosynthesis works at the molecular level. In part two, Morton addresses evidence of how plants may have kick-started the complex life cycle on Earth. The book's final part considers photosynthesis in relation to global warming, for, he says, the Earth's plant-based balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is broken: in burning vast amounts of fossil fuels, we are emitting more carbon dioxide than the plants can absorb. But Morton also explores the possibility that our understanding of photosynthesis might be harnessed to regain that balance. Readers should persevere through (or skim) the more technical discussions in the first part, for what follows is a vast, elegant synthesis of biology, physics and environmental science that can inform our discussions of urgent issues.(Nov. 4)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While roaming in the Special Collections Room, Neil encounters a talking teddy bear that blackmails him into traveling back to the Blitz in London in order to rescue his four-year-old brother, Josh, who had been tricked by the magical bear. As Neil and Ted maneuver around London, meeting American soldiers, local people, and even a German spy, a demon breaks loose from the museum into the past as well, and, suddenly, in order to save the future and change the past, they must recapture it. Jarvis tries to do too many things with this story and ends up not doing any of them well. Time-travel fantasy and family drama are mixed in with horror-the descriptions of those killed by the demon are very graphic-and a dose of Nordic mythology and sentimentality. Hints are dropped about the origins and identities of the museum's owners, but only readers with a background in mythology will understand the references to weaving that they make. The plot involving Josh is dropped almost completely until the book's end when he magically reappears, and making one of the female characters an ambitious German spy pushes the whole thing just too far over the edge.Lisa Prolman, Greenfield Public Library,Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Woven Path (Tales from the Wyrd Museum)", "price": 1.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 5062386}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FP1AZA0GL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0816770069"]}},

But Levy, film critic for thePortland Oregonian, goes beyond the glitz to see Rubirosa as a product of a particular time and place: dictator Trujillo's Dominican Republic. Like many Trujillo intimates, Rubirosa was well paid for his loyalty, not his labor. By the 1960s, when Rubirosa crashed his Ferrari in Paris's Bois de Boulogne, he was an anachronism&mdash;at that point, even wealthy men were trying to have careers of some sort.

The author, who has studied and written about what she calls \"high sensitivity\" (The Highly Sensitive Person), states that this is a personality trait that occurs in 15% to 20% of the population. Although HSCs tend to be \"empathetic, smart, intuitive, careful and conscientious,\" they are also easily overstimulated and require informed parenting in order to prevent temper tantrums, stress illnesses and the avoidance of pleasurable group activities. Aron offers helpful advice that will assist both nonsensitive and highly sensitive parents through all stages of their child's development from infancy to adolescence. For example, since HSCs have great difficulty with change, it is necessary to prepare them gently so that they do not feel powerless during transitions. According to the author, there are four basic strategies that will help an HSC to become a happy adult: parents should foster their child's self-esteem, try to reduce the feelings of shame HSCs may develop because they are different, employ only mild positive discipline and learn how to talk positively to teachers and friends about their HSC so that interactions will be productive.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Highly Sensitive Child: Helping Our Children Thrive When the World Overwhelms Them", "price": 9.39, "salesRank": {"Books": 2415584}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iqxWZgReL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0966074521", "0553062182", "0767903374", "1452566925", "1572243961", "0767903366", "B005DI6RA6", "0060739665", "0757316123", "0897935098", "0446674990", "1439200327", "0767914929", "1618210823", "1451663889", "0060527188", "1601632843", "1452578567", "156414948X", "1591473144", "0060932929", "0060930438", "0595098002", "0312329784", "0761135243", "006073602X", "1593635443", "0060952407", "B001TBYOWE", "B005BU3EO8", "0071596909", "0415800749", "0738211850", "0143115340", "0060923288", "0767903358", "1593634900", "1466263539", "1572245751", "0684838656", "0062270451", "0307352153", "0345493966", "1462510078", "0399531653", "0399537694", "0553386697", "0983625689", "1433813394", "1575421763", "0312615523", "0786883146", "1575423162", "1433803186", "0307341607", "1433801345", "B00E9WIC14", "B006HT2T20", "1575423464", "1416583009", "0770436595", "0807563811", "B00000JN49", "1897238452", "0375826319", "1433804506", "0142410586", "B00000DMF5", "1608828840", "0807588970", "0978507517", "0807594733", "B003AH6NII", "155971624X", "B000090W81", "1592403352", "1611800587", "B0000YWF5E", "1591478057", "B00DGK6HGM", "B00005BW71", "B004X8GJPA", "B00EJAEWW4", "B006H28VOW", "B0038QQ7KA", "0545019230", "1414313632", "0393342212", "B001GAQKKW", "B003AYEHIO", "B00ESMT5CK", "1889140430", "B0092ZW6FG", "B002BRSCJ6", "B00364E1DE", "B000XSAZUO", "1933054395", "006074104X", "B0037Z8DEK", "0802403476"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0553062182", "0060739665", "0966074521", "0767903366"]}},

With his smallish stature, knobby  knees, and slightly crooked forelegs, he looked more like a cow pony than a  thoroughbred. But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote,  \"was mostly in his heart.\" Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who  became a cultural icon inSeabiscuit: An American Legend.Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner  Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that \"the day of the horse  is past\"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who \"had cultivated an almost mystical  communication with horses\"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck  when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube.  Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of \"team Seabiscuit,\" from early training  sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to \"Horse of the  Year\"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also  describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern  journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great  thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas  in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as  his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle  while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose  chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San  Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering \"Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em,  you old devil!\"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes  on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and  taunted them with his blistering speed.Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue (\"His history had  the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow\"; \"The California sunlight  had the pewter cast of a declining season\"), Hillenbrand has crafted a  delightful book. Wire to wire,Seabiscuitis a winner.

Snow's ( The Monster Book of ABC Sounds ) dry, witty remarks supplement illustrations including a stem-to-stern cross-section of an all-purpose breed that exposes a network of sensors and tubing.

Despite the well-planned diagrams and agreeable drawings of grinning pets, the clinical, deadpan humor sometimes falls flat, and the concept of animal-as-machine seems contradicted by the presence of mini-pups that apparently monitor the canine controls.

For young Ella, the heroine of Gail Carson Levine's Newbury Honor-winning debutnovel, this is more than a fanciful wish; it could be a matter of life or death. Placed under the spell of a blundering fairy, she has no choice but to go through life obeying each and every order--no matter what the consequences may be. \"If you commanded me to cut off my own head, I'd have to do it.\"Eden Riegel (As the World Turns,Les Miserables) uses her youthful, energetic voice to lead the listener into a familiar world of fairy godmothers, wicked stepsisters, and handsome princes. But this imaginative retelling of the Cinderella story comes with a welcome twist. Instead of a demure heroine patiently awaiting a prince who will carry her off, this Ella is a feisty ball of fire with the courage and ambition to take matters into her own hands.Riegel narrates in a youthful, energetic tone that is perfectly suited to Ella's character. Her voice adds charm and immediacy to a wonderful story already rich with excitement, adventure, romance, and mystery.

From  Julius Caesar to the 10th-century Arabs; from Mary Queen of Scots to \"Alice and  Bob\"; from the Germans' Enigma machine to the Navajo code talkers in World War  II, Singh traces the use of code to protect--and betray--secrecy. Moving right  into the present, he describes how the Information Age has provided a whole new  set of challenges for cryptographers. How private are your e-mail  communications? How secure is sending your credit card information over the  Internet? And how much secrecy will the government tolerate?

Here 12-year-old Zeinab is given by her father to Napoleon in a Muslim marriage that is never consummated and later finds brief happiness in a marriage with chief engineer Nicolas Conte of the French Scientific Commission. Disavowed by her father, she is saved from being executed for treason by her pregnancy, then sheltered by the aristocratic philanthropist Sitt Nafisa the White. Serageldin recounts the devastation wrought on her home country by its successively more abusive occupiers&#x2014;the French, followed by the Turks and Albanians, who executed the leaders of the long-prominent Mamluke military caste&#x2014;in the context of the politics of the times.

As in her first book, American Muslims, she passionately argues against stereotypes and in favor of an Islam that sounds a lot like Reform Judaism or liberal Christianity. This is the Islam she knew growing up in Pueblo, Colo.&#x97;an American girl who looked Chicana and attended a Catholic school. Hasan's version of Islam would have appealed to America's founders with its advocacy of human equality, religious tolerance, property rights and self-improvement. It harmonizes just as well with 21st-century America's spiritual inclinations: it is nonjudgmental, inclusive, open-minded, diverse, experiential, emotional and even feminist. \"The Prophet Muhammad is personally responsible for the greatest advancement of women's rights in a single time period,\" she writes, noting that no Islamic justification exists for abuses such as female genital mutilation or stoning adulteresses; these stem from ancient patriarchal traditions that pre-date Islam. Not all American Muslims welcome Hasan's interpretation of their faith or appreciate her enthusiasm for America (she recounts several experiences with such antagonists and suggests that they move to an Islamic country). Unfazed, she counters: \"I'll make my own tradition&#x97;one that embodies my own American Muslim ethnic culture.[Hasan's italics]\"-\" This is do-it-yourself American religion at its most appealing.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007163630", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this lively chronicle, historian Francis (Transcendental Utopias) offers a compelling portrait of the decline of Puritan ways in the late 17th century and the ascent of a secular spirit in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Although devout, Samuel Sewall (1652&ndash;1730) turned away from an early religious vocation to pursue a career in public office and married into the colony's aristocracy. He found himself catapulted into the limelight as one of nine judges who condemned the alleged witches of Salem in 1692. Francis calls this the turning point in Sewall's life and work. Never convinced that the condemned women were guilty, Sewall felt remorse; in 1697 he walked into a Boston church and offered a public apology, the only one of the three judges to do so. As a result, he was rebuffed by his social circle. Yet, according to Francis, Sewall's courage is magnified by his taking a stand he knew would result in ostracism. In his later years, Sewall wrote tracts opposing the colonists' treatment of Indians and slaves. Francis beautifully captures not only Sewall's personality and significance but also the shifting times in which he lived, when it was becoming no longer possible to \"see the world as a simple allegorical struggle between... good and evil.\" B&amp;w illus.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

InFeather Boy, Nicky Singer traces a character-defining sequence of events  in the life of a boy named Robert Nobel. He is often the butt of classroom jokes  and pranks--and being called Norbert No-bottle all the time isn't much fun  either. He secretly wants to be somebody. To have a voice. To have friends.Robert's participation in the Elders Project changes his life forever. Selected  members of his class are chosen to visit and interact with the elderly residents  of Mayfield Rest Home--to find out about their lives and to \"counter ignorant  attitudes about such senior members of society.\" Robert's main attacker,  classmate Jonathan Niker, considers the old people \"vegetables,\" but Robert's  own buried true-life personality is slowly unearthed by Edith--a prickly  resident who singles him out. Edith is considered quite mad; she's haunted by  the unhappy memories of her son's tragic death at her previous home, Chance  House. As Edith's condition deteriorates and the Elders Project heads towards  its conclusion, Robert is drawn deeper and deeper into her story. His visits to  the derelict Chance House become more frequent, and one fateful trip to sleep  there overnight as a dare with Niker heralds the first step on Robert's own  journey in search of his real self.Feather Boyis more than just a story about bullying. It's about finding  your voice, shouting from the rooftops about something you believe in, refusing  to back down, helping a friend, and never giving up.

Come on.\" So don't expect heavy-duty style or even plot from this likable 30-something&mdash;she's just blogging, alright? Overall, Smartypants is something of a hypochondriac, with frequent passages on her colds and other ailments, like her \"exquisitely painful leg cramps.\" Sometimes she drinks too much, with hangovers that tie into the hypochondria. The narrative's quirky images (e.g., too much caffeine makes the author's spine feel \"like a glass harmonica\") and odd suggestions (e.g., try hydrating those compressed-foam animals in a mouthful of beer) certainly give pause, as do her occasional word inventions (e.g., making muffins, she describes those \"large lipomas of butter\" trapped in the hand mixer). Nothing beats Smartypants's discussion of how the \"pseudo-Aztec design\" on the Tostitos bag resembles a uterus with ovaries.

{"asin": "0007181639", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Those who fear the dry and impenetrable prose of many political essays need have no such reservations with this selection. Indian author Roy (The God of Small Things) brings a novelistic readability and immediacy to her impassioned critiques of imperialism, the corporate media and their \"neo-liberal project\"&#x97;what she describes as \"the medium of those who have power and money.\" Her unequivocally critical look at the Bush administration&#x92;s policy in Iraq will likely lead American readers to label her as either brilliantly astute or strongly anti-American. Still, she carefully differentiates between governments and their people. In \"Instant Mix Imperial Democracy,\" she congratulates Americans for standing up to their government: \"Hundreds of thousands of you have survived the relentless propaganda you have been subjected to, and are actively fighting your own government. In the ultra-patriotic climate that prevails in the United States, that&#x92;s as brave as any Iraqi or Afghan or Palestinian fighting for his or her Homeland.\" In the same talk, Roy delivers a scathing critique of the current state of democracy: \"The project of corporate globalization has cracked the code of democracy. Free elections, a free press and an independent judiciary mean little when the free market has reduced them to commodities on sale to the highest bidder.\" In addition to observing problems; Roy suggests non-violent solutions&#x97;boycotts, protests and open discussion. Regardless of whether one agrees with her ideas, Roy crafts articulate and convincing arguments that deserve their place in any debate on globalization, democracy or Iraq.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007190360", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This sprawling conspiracy theory traces the influence of ancient Egyptian and gnostic ideologies concerning a dualistic, Manichean cosmos prefiguring the earthly order, knowable only through secret, magical lore from medieval Catharism to the French vogue for pharaonic monuments and deities, the astrologically suggestive layouts of Paris and Washington, and the Statue of Liberty (the \"Isis of New York\"). The conventional explanation for the historical recurrence of gnostic themes and Egyptian iconography&mdash;that people peruse old texts and art works and adapt their ideas and symbols to new purposes&mdash;strikes Hancock and Bauval (coauthors ofKeeper of Genesis) as inadequate. They discern the millennia-long plot of a shadowy gnostic \"Organization\" working through usual suspects like the Freemasons, whose hidden hand they see influencing everything from the French Revolution to the founding of Israel. The authors draw eye-glazing webs of connections between historical coincidences&mdash;some intriguing, others tenuous and forced&mdash;to insinuate a \"not altogether impossible\" master plan. But their proposed conspiracy never gels. Its guiding philosophies, Christian gnosticism and pagan occultism, don't really mesh, and its agenda seems no more coherent than a perennial opposition to the alleged intolerance and obscurantism of the Catholic Church. The book's crude anticlericalism and conviction that culture propagates by conspiratorial, not intellectual, processes make it a distortion of the gnostic mindset.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Alas! Everyone, but everyone, takes advantage of his generosity, and before long he has three-quarters of the animal kingdom nesting in the convenient perches atop his head. (\"They asked in a fox, who jumped in from the trees, / They asked in some mice and they asked in some fleas.\") You might think someone would take pity, but nobody seems to like an oddball, and all Thidwick gets for his trouble is complaints and contempt.

{"asin": "0007190042", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The latest addition to McDermid's dark and gritty police procedurals, which have become even more popular thanks to the BBC America TV programThe Wire in the Blood, finds the series' usual main protagonists, psychologist/profiler Dr. Tony Hill and Det. Chief Insp. Carol Jordan, joined by DI Don Merrick, elevated from the ranks of supporting players. Topping their docket are two serial killers: a child molester who murders and hides his young male victims and the Creeper, who tortures and slays prostitutes using the identical modus operandi of a killer firmly ensconced in a mental facility. McDermid's strength is the engaging and multidimensional characters he creates on both sides of the law. The book was a finalist for the CWA's 2004 Gold Dagger Award, but this audio abridgment is more interested in story than in character. There are several effective set pieces, notably an undercover sting that goes bad, resulting in the abduction and torture of a novice policewoman, and Merrick's life and death struggle with the child predator. At these points, Doyle's competent but undistinguished performance rises to the challenge. But by trimming away the novels' strongest element&mdash;its vibrant characters&mdash;the abridgment highlights the novel's weakest element: the less than credible sequences leading to the identity and capture of the Creeper.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007194161", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Clevenger's debut novel is a well-crafted but underplotted character study of a brilliant, damaged man who struggles with mental illness and substance abuse as he bounces in and out of prison and a series of hospitals around Los Angeles. Most of the novel takes place in the latter setting; some tense early scenes pit protagonist John Dolan Vincent against a psychiatrist known as \"The Evaluator,\" who probes Vincent's psyche to see if his recent overdose of muscle relaxants was really a botched attempt to cure his migraine, as Vincent claims, or a suicide attempt. The twist is that Vincent has checked into the hospital under an assumed name; after each of his previous overdoses he has changed his identity to avoid being placed in a mental hospital. The psychiatric interview provides a decent vehicle for telling the story of Vincent's difficult family life and his decision to use his mathematical talent to assist a murky criminal network. The trouble is that Clevenger has little to offer to push his story forward besides Vincent's efforts to protect Keadra, the woman he falls in love with during a hospital stint, from the thugs who are trying to track him down. Clevenger is a solid writer who does some good work when it comes to creating a noirish atmosphere and smart, compelling characters, but the pace is uneven at best. The quality of the writing warrants a follow-up effort; hopefully, Clevenger will know what to do with his characters the next time around.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Contortionist's Handbook", "price": 40.68, "salesRank": {"Books": 3245616}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGEVFN54L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1596921021", "1931561753", "0140289011", "0312352190", "1250035953", "0307275833", "039333807X", "0307476537", "0670881759", "0385533039", "1613641621", "0684853159", "0393319296", "076792830X", "0976631156", "0375703764", "1605427349", "0670889202", "0385720920", "0375713344", "0374532885", "0385722222", "098554550X", "0140291873", "1400079373", "1940430046", "0393327345", "0679781498", "0679743243", "0385722192", "1400030927", "0394726413", "1931561826", "0307476898", "0679735771", "067978148X", "0393329003", "0425173305", "0385415443", "0394569024", "0307744868", "0957091907", "0802140149", "0982628145", "0393313964", "0375706682", "1933929065", "0804139024", "1400032814", "0140186255", "1933929014", "0307275841", "1933929693", "038533348X", "1250036658", "0679723226", "0307887448", "1555975771", "0316066524", "0099427869", "0061147966", "0316777730", "1592404308", "0061944890", "0547572298", "1400032822", "0312924585", "0679720200", "B000GP0O0U", "1400032717", "0060532246", "0394539931", "061595409X", "0981502741"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1931561753", "0140289011", "0312352190", "0393327345"]}},

Logan MacRae police procedural (after 2006'sDying Light), the Aberdeen police, on the trail of a serial rapist, catch Scottish sports hero Rob Macintyre stalking tarted-up Woman Police Constable Jackie Watson, MacRae's live-in lover. Macintyre's arrest ignites public sentiment against the police, stifling the investigation. Meanwhile, a second case drags MacRae into the local s&amp;m scene, where he gets an unexpected education in the sordid details from his red-faced assistant constable, and then he has to track down an eight-year-old killer. The one thing the three cases have in common is that nothing is what it seems. MacRae bounces back and forth among them, yanked between two cranky, childlike detective inspectors demanding overtime and loyalty.

In \"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\" Gilbert Wolfscale struggles with drought and debt to hold on to the ranch that has been passed down in his family for generations, driving off his wife and two sons, who have no interest in continuing the legacy. Many old-time ranch owners in this territory are women, and they face similar struggles: in \"The Trickle Down Effect,\" Fiesta Punch hires local ne'er-do-well Deb Sipple for a long-distance hay haul, with disastrous results. Proulx does leaven her tales of hardship and woe with a dry humor, and she doesn't forget to tackle the misguided romance sought by newcomers to the land, as in \"Man Crawling Out of Trees,\" in which a retired couple from the Northeast find that the quiet truce of their marriage can't survive encounters with the resentful locals. While none of the stories in this collection approaches the sweep and wholeness of \"Brokeback Mountain\" (the standout story fromClose Range, and soon to be a major film), and other pieces are little more than whimsical sketches (sometimes with a touch of the magical), they paint a rich, colorful picture of local life.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chan (whom Quan created for her Salon online column) is a \"successful\" (read: expensive) prostitute who spends more time listing her favorite clothes, restaurants and cosmetic tips than even Bret Easton Ellis did in American Psycho. In between $400-per-hour quickies at exclusive hotels, Nancy and her happy hooker pals Jasmine and Allison attend sex-industry activist meetings and debate the sinister reappearance of Jack, a former john who now appears to be obsessed with Allison. Nancy whines about this and her deepening relationship with her commitment-minded boyfriend to her shrink, also revealing how she plunged into prostitution as a teen. The novel has neither a substantial plot (Nancy dithering over whether to marry her dream boyfriend and get out of the life) nor sex appeal: Nancy's descriptions of her sensual encounters, be they professional or personal, are about as erotic as a stereo instruction manual (\"always do a few extra Kegels afterwards\"). Fans of Quan's online column may enjoy the continuation of Nancy's X-rated soap opera, but first-time readers may be put off by her snobbishness.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 3846167}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uoZUJq5pL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1402214642", "1926745493", "1597775940", "0060014164", "0753821605", "1400053544", "044654082X", "0743289757", "0978094409", "1409113841", "1592573681"], "buy_after_viewing": ["044654082X", "B007MXCXVC", "1580051693", "1597775940"]}},

Having seduced a silly Austrian princess on the ship bearing the body of Maximilian, the ill-fated emperor of Mexico, back home to Trieste in 1867, Harry eludes the offended Austrian authorities by seizing the chance to become the British envoy on a mission to rescue a group of European hostages held by the mad Abyssinian king, Theodore. (When Whitehall neglected to respond to the polite letter Theodore wrote Queen Victoria, he took captive a few hundred unfortunate foreigners.) This now obscure expedition, which made headlines in its day, provides the kind of sardonic history lesson fans have come to relish. Allusions to adventures not yet published tantalize, notably those to do with Flashman's role in the U.S. Civil War. Fraser has nibbled at the edges (Flashy was there for John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1995'sFlashman and the Angel of the Lord), and one can only hope that the next volume does more than simply mention such iconic names as Gettysburg.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That experience, recorded in Hayden's One Child, which became a TV movie, is updated in this deeply moving sequel. It picks up with Sheila as a sullen 13-year-old bouncing between juvenile facilities and her father's \"care.\" As Hayden renews her ties to Sheila?first at a clinic, then through informal contacts?the girl's outbursts and foul-mouthed sexual preoccupations betray a desperate craving for a sense of belonging. An inspirational testament to the healing power of love, this authentic tearjerker resonates with drama. There is no storybook ending: Sheila, with an IQ over 180, forgoes college to work for McDonald's; an epilogue finds her 10 years later as a branch manager at McDonald's and an articulate, stable woman.

{"asin": "0007196091", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The charts are full of stories of childhood abuse now, Elliott writes, and speculates that fans of childhood abuse literature want to be shocked at the start of the book, crying in the middle and exultant at the end. Her account (Jane Elliott is a pseudonym) adds little that is fresh to the genre beyond that her [s]eventeen years was an astonishingly long time to have been systematically abused. A good part of this true story of a four-year-old girl who fell into the power of a man for whom evil was a relentless daily activity is devoted to the shock&mdash;graphic detail of her stepfather's physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Some readers will feel for Elliott as she continues to be victimized by a thoroughly amoral lunatic head of an incredibly dysfunctional family; others may find that the explicit detail teeters perilously close to the pornography of violence and of sexual degradation. While Elliott's stepfather is eventually sentenced to 15 years, little exultancy follows until Elliott decides to tell her story and achieves British bestsellerdom. Elliott's account, written with Crofts, makes fascinating reading as one wonders, in page-turner fashion, whether anyone will stop this man from terrorizing his stepdaughter, her mother, her siblings and the entire neighborhood. The vagueness of time and place, however, raise disquieting questions about reality.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007192932", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Illes, the author of three previous books on magical spells, has compiled a lively and chatty reference on witches. The work is arranged topically, and there is a helpful index. Individual articles within the topic chapters sometimes haveseereferences as well. After a long introduction discussing several different and sometimes nearly mutually exclusive definitions of witches, chapters cover plants, animals, food and drink, magical beings, famous people in the magical world, the creative arts, witch persecution, and more. Chapters--or sections within the chapters--includeA-Zentries that range from a few paragraphs to a few pages. An extensive bibliography and a list of Internet resources complete the work.Illes focuses most strongly on Western European witchcraft practice and history, but she gives considerable attention to Asian, African, Mesoamerican, Caribbean, and South American practice as well. The creative arts chapter is up-to-date enough to discuss the Harry Potter phenomenon as well as many films, television programs, and other arts-related representations. Illes' take on the representation of witches inThe Wizard of Ozis in solidarity with witch practice.The book is long and could have used editing both to trim the text and to correct errors in spelling and grammar. Illes tends to overwrite when she feels passionately, and an editor would have helped with this as well. The horrors of witch persecutions--which continue in many places to this day--do not require overwriting, as William Burns shows very well inWitch Hunts in Europe and America(Greenwood, 2003), which is not in the bibliography.Academic libraries with extensive witchcraft collections may wish to consider this volume if only for the bibliography. Public libraries seeking a popular reference work on witchcraft could do much worse than this one.

He discusses not only the environmental consequences of melting icecaps, ocean warming, coral reef bleaching, CO2 emissions, deforestation, and severe weather, but also cultural and economic reverberations-the result of population shifts, animal migrations, and societal collapse. Through computer-modeling simulations he looks back into the past (the Pliocene, the Mayan civilization) and projects into the future for CO2 comparisons. His premise: the problem is now at global scale and will not just impact the disappearance of one group alone as it did the Maya. Claiming that solutions must be political, and that it is too late for quick fixes using renewable energy sources or technology, he concludes with some cautionary possible solutions: relocalization of goods and services, less consumption, global-scale carbon rationing, and a \"2 degree increase target.\" Anyone studying climate change will find this a helpful reference as much current research has been precompiled and interpreted within one resource.&mdash;Jodi Mitchell, Berkeley Public Library, CACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This curious work&mdash;half fiction, half memoir, hampered by slapdash prose and an unfocused organization&mdash;may be the result of that unsettling time, when she said she didn't have the energy to write a full novel. The opening novella (the longer of the two pieces) is what might have become of her parents, Alfred Tayler and Emily McVeagh, if they had never married. The sluggish account of their parallel lives is notable mainly for Lessing's commentary on the changing economic, social and cultural mores in England before and after WWI. The second section is a rambling series of recollections that describe the family's failed farm in Southern Rhodesia. Lessing describes her mother's dominating personality, attributing her mother's smothering attention to her frustration at having given up a successful wartime nursing career and a vital social life to raise a family. Lessing's longtime readers will find little new in her autobiographical disclosures, and new readers will look in vain for the talent that won the Nobel. 11 b&amp;w photos.(Aug.)\"\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007231989", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The Pulitzer Prize winner and author of Brokeback Mountain portrays her flawed paradise in the majestic, hardscrabble West in this vibrant memoir. Proulx bought a 640-acre nature preserve by the North Platte River in Wyoming and started building her dream house, a project that took years and went hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget. In her bustling account, Proulx salivates over the prospect of a Japanese soak tub, polished concrete floor, solar panels, and luxe furnishings that often turn into pricey engineering fiascoes. The meticulous master builders she dubs the James Gang are the book's heroes. Though the house never quite lives up to its promise, it does inspire the author's engrossing natural history of the locale. Proulx drives cattle off of the overgrazed terrain; finds stone arrowheads; recounts the lore of the Indians, ranchers, and foppish big-game hunters who contested the land; and documents the antics of the eagles, magpies, mountain lions, and other critters who tolerate her presence. Like her fiction, Proulx's memoir flows from a memorable landscape where \"the sagebrush seems nearly black and beaten low by the ceaseless wind\"; the result is a fine evocation of place that becomes a meditation on the importance of a home, however harsh and evanescent.

{"asin": "0007230206", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand.

Eventually the travelers reach land, returning to Gunnar's previously established settlement. When Peer discovers the evidence of a murder, relations with the ruthless Vikings begin to deteriorate. After a near-deadly confrontation with Harald, Peer flees and finds refuge with a civilization based on the Native American Mi'kmaq people. They help him to recover and treat him with kindness. When it's discovered that Harald has cold-bloodedly murdered two of their warriors, the tribe is bent on revenge. Peer must find a way to free Hilde from the Vikings and shield her from the violence to come. Langrish skillfully weaves Norse and Native American mythology among the fantasy and adventure elements. Mythical creatures and mystical elements abound, and magic is an everyday part of the characters' existence. Peer and Hilde are now teenagers, and their changing relationship&mdash;from friendship to romance&mdash;is believably depicted. Fans of the first two books will enjoy this one.&mdash;Ginny Collier, Dekalb County Public Library, Decatur, GACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And the more he eats, the smarter he gets. When he starts eating too many too fast, he can no longer digest them, and their contents get all mixed up. The simple cartoon illustrations twinkle with humor and feeling. Done in paint and pencil on smart backdrops&mdash;pages from old books&mdash;the pictures set the stage for the quirky story. When forced to give up eating his favorite volumes, Henry eventually learns to enjoy reading them. However, an actual bite taken out of the back cover suggests he still succumbs to the occasional indulgence. This well-done package will charm its audience.

This time around, veteran detective Patrik Hedstr&#xF6;m investigates a fatal crash involving a local shop owner. Hedstr&#xF6;m fears foul play when he learns that the victim, a teetotaler, had an astonishingly high blood-alcohol level.Turns out, a few unsolved cases over the years had similar circumstances, and Hedstr&#xF6;m considers the possibility that they are all connected. Adding to the detective&#x2019;s woes is an obnoxious reality show (is there any other kind?) that has descended upon Fjallbacka.

{"asin": "000725931X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This collection of 100-plus comfort foods from UK television personality Allen may be a hit in her native country, but probably won't fare as well across the pond. Though she offers conversions for most measurements, American cooks will likely be frustrated with her vague (or absent) descriptions of ingredients like \"flat mushroom\" (shiitake?) for Mini Mushroom Bruschetta with Rocket, Olives and Parmesan, and Smarties (the British equivalent of M&Ms;) in her Polka-Dot Cookies. Still, dishes like a kid-friendly Croque Monsieur, Chicken with Lemon and Honey and Pan-Fried Scallops with Truffle Beurre Blanc are on the mark, as are Baked Eggs with Chorizo, Cream and Cheese and sides like honey roasted parsnips. A lengthy digression on sherries, however, is likely to bore rather than inform, and a page devoted to fresh-squeezed juice is barely worth including. Too hit-or-miss to wholly recommend, entries like mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, brownies and burgers push it into dangerously pedestrian territory. Rounded out with quintessentially British tips (how serve tea and sandwiches, etc.) this will best be appreciated by fans of Allen in particular.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After their teacher announces a knowledge-bowl competition, they are determined to beat school meanies Emma and Emily (the &#x201C;M&amp;Ms&#x201D;), and they just might, with new brainiac Rosie on their team. But the M&amp;Ms will do anything to win, even steal the Sleepover Club&#x2019;s bear mascot.

{"asin": "0007251971", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Irish chef Cotter's lyrical rumination on local fruits and vegetables is much like a relaxing Sunday afternoon walk in the country. Following a loose structure, Cotter wanders from topic to topic, from discussing the etymology of sea spinach to an early morning wild mushroom hunt with little transition. While this may frustrate some readers, Cotter covers a remarkable amount of culinary ground and eventually gets to all the major players in the garden, from root vegetables and tomatoes to multiple varieties of kale and the joys of fresh asparagus. Supplemented with plenty of recipes for dishes ranging from the familiar (Tomatillo Salsa, Field Mushroom and Potato Gratin) to the exotic (Nettle Risotto, Watercress Soup with Walnut and Sweet Pepper Salsa), the real treasures are buried in the text, where Cotter offers numerous riffs on standards like beets, and how to employ turnips in a curry. Readers accustomed to skimming will gloss over many of the jewels scattered throughout the book, but patient cooks will be rewarded with a renewed appreciation for their garden's bounty.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What distinguishes it is its author's British accent; the co-founder of an English catering company, Abel's takes on Heekerbeeker Kedgeree and The One and Only Traditional Cornish Pasty look and taste like a weekend in Brighton. Other recipes show off New British Cooking at its most cosmopolitan: Venison Saltimbocca is a novel twist on an Italian classic, while Lemon Sole with Wine, Toasted Almonds and Capers exposes the Brits' deep connection to France. India also proves influential, in treats like Bombayed Jersey Royals, a snappy potato dish, or Calcutta Lamb Burgers with Radish and Yogurt Salad, a loving tribute to two former British colonies. There aren't as many desserts as one might expect-after all, Brits are known for their \"puddings\"-but the few included, such as Mulled Wine, Pears and Clementines with Dark Chocolate Shavings, are all winners.

{"asin": "0007279043", "description": "Grade 6&ndash;8&mdash;The protagonist in this offbeat story is Dennis, a 12-year-old boy whose eclectic interests range from football (soccer) to fashion. He's mocked for his purchase ofVoguemagazine but he just can't resist poring over the photo shoots, enamored with the color, cut, and style of women's dresses. Dennis meets up with Lisa, the school hottie, who is two years older and also a fashion aficionado. She plays dress up with Dennis and convinces him to come to school as \"Denise,\" a French exchange student. Hilarity ensues as soccer-star Dennis, outfitted in an orange sequined sheath, complete with wig and makeup, attempts to pull off the ruse. This quirky comedy also has poignant moments between Dennis and his dad and brother. It's a quick read and Blake's stylistic line illustrations are the icing on the cake. All that being said, it's difficult to predict an audience for this book. Younger students may be turned off by the Briticisms, and it's a bit too juvenile for older readers.&mdash;Patricia N.

Atticus Perennis is a Roman of Greek ancestry and master of the trireme Aquila. Septimus Capito is one of the first marine Centurions. The two brothers-in-arms must confront both the vagaries of the Senate, with its backstabbing, self-aggrandizing politics, and the difficulties of developing the concept of naval warfare.

The collective future of the humans, elves, dwarves, dragons and other fantastical inhabitants of Deverry is in jeopardy. Savage Horsekin tribes escalate their bloody assaults on Northlands settlements in the name of their goddess, Alshandra. As apprentice wizard Neb struggles to come to grips with his past life as the powerful sorcerer Nevyn, the magical island of Haen Marn suddenly reappears from nowhere, and few can agree whether this bodes well or ill. With multiple simultaneous plot lines, many of them dealing with relationships in past incarnations, pacing and continuity wallow, and the ending is merely an arrangement of chess pieces for the complex endgame of the final volume (tentatively titledThe Silver Mage).(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007285973", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* Sorting through her parents&#x2019; possessions after their deaths, Mair Ellis discovers a Kashmir shawl that once belonged to her Welsh grandmother, Nerys Watkins. Nestled within the folds of this exquisite handwoven piece is an envelope containing a single lock of hair. Curiosity drives Mair to trace the history of the shawl, a quest that takes her from Wales to India. As she pieces together her grandmother&#x2019;s past, the two women&#x2019;s stories intertwine, transporting the reader between the Kashmir of WWII and the present day. The bulk of the novel belongs to Nerys, a missionary&#x2019;s wife whose undemonstrative husband urges her to spend the winter in Srinigar with a friend while he spreads Christianity in remote settlements. Nerys is forever changed in this romantic city, blossoming in an illicit affair while being swept up in the dangerous unraveling of another&#x2019;s. The consequences resurface nearly seven decades later, leaving Mair with a life-altering decision. An avid traveler and thorough researcher, Thomas brings the flavors and colors of India to life with vivid detail and develops characters so real one feels a kinship. An engrossing, intelligent, and satisfying read, this publication is the American debut of a UK best-seller. --Diane Holcomb--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Kashmir Shawl", "price": 11.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 708219}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/912HNTmZV6L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1451655827", "0062188518", "0143125435", "1476703558", "1594486433", "0007173547", "0007285949", "1451655789", "055359253X", "1468308785", "1476703574", "0007173520", "0062273450", "0767919378", "0307590445", "1571746854", "1847391400", "0061950726", "1250031613", "1849832889", "1476746583", "037597136X", "0805094490", "1451681755", "0451465822", "0451419480", "1605985724", "1451606346", "1849835314", "1496190459", "0758292759", "1439152810", "0451240464", "0758278454", "0099464861", "0670024783", "0316055433", "1611099285", "140913590X", "0399157980", "0143126474", "0758285752", "0062237195", "161218426X", "1612183328", "1402293313", "0345528689", "0749040262", "0452298393", "1552782492", "0143123920", "0062234463", "1616203218", "0061710245", "0062257846", "1590516400", "0451416635", "1477807675", "1451672799", "0307950433", "0988940833", "0062077309", "0316176494", "140227663X", "0452298385", "0749009012", "1451698984", "0399162178", "1594632294", "0778316211", "0062310771", "1402258615", "0345525558", "0425261263", "0062077880", "0062229311", "1496147111", "1611173914", "0099464837", "1439101124", "0062300377", "1250027861", "1439153663", "1611458315", "0143124544", "0758278438", "0062065254", "1451623496", "0142196991", "0991097505", "1476743509", "1400069491", "1250040779", "0143121103", "0778314391", "0345527275", "1476709017", "0452297648", "1472212746", "0142180548"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062188518", "1476703558", "1476746583", "0767919378"]}},

{"asin": "0007269854", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. At the start of L&auml;ckberg's haunting U.S. debut, the first of her seven novels set in the Swedish coastal town of Fj&auml;llbacka, biographer Erica Falck returns home to sort through her deceased parents' belongings and work on her next book. But this is not the same hometown she grew up in. Summer tourists are turning the former fishing village into a thriving resort, and Erica's controlling brother-in-law is pressuring her to cash in by selling the family home. The apparent suicide of childhood friend Alexandra Wijkner contributes to Erica's grief. Once inseparable, they drifted apart before Alex's family abruptly moved away, and Erica feels compelled to write a novel about why the beautiful Alex would kill herself. L&auml;ckberg skillfully details how horrific secrets are never completely buried and how silence can kill the soul. A parallel between the town's downward spiral and the fate of one of Fj&auml;llbacka's wealthiest families adds texture.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This time, he creates an intricate fictional world in which the tiny Sparkler&#x2014;Peter Pan&#x2013;like in his mischief, Ulysses-esque in his cunning&#x2014;holds together three separate stories. Tollins are tiny, nectar-eating woodland creatures with elf ears and wings but bigger than the fairies they casually use as handkerchiefs. They enjoy an idyllic existence until a fireworks factory is built in the village of Chorleywood. One of the Tollins falls into a rocket, producing the most bang for the buck ever witnessed, and the men of the village hunt the Tollins down to use as fodder for their fireworks. Parts 2 and 3 continue Sparkler&#x2019;s perils and escapes from prison, execution, and a runaway hot-air balloon. Sparkler is a self-made scientist&#x2014;it&#x2019;s great fun to see him using applied chemistry for fireworks, finding herbs for medicine, and discovering the first steam engine. Duncan&#x2019;s full-color illustrations and maps bring the world to witty life. A note at the end likens the Tollins&#x2019; fate to child labor during the Industrial Revolution. There is much to think about and love in this beautifully realized world.

As Alborough's (It's the Bear; My Friend Bear) words roll out in an infectious, hard-hitting beat with more than a few rhythmic surprises, he metes out his bold pictures in perfect accompaniment. A triptych of vignettes creates a slow-motion effect as the truck first strikes a rock, is then shown aloft, and finally hits the muck; close-up spreads focus on the exasperated characters attempting to budge the vehicle. With light-hearted tension, wry characterizations and lots of squishy mud, this tale makes for a quacking good read-aloud. Ages 3-6.

For some reason the scenes remind me of the Teletubbies and the surreal fantasy world that they live in. The Octonauts and their adventures will be easily loved by little ones but I find the illustrations are very inspiring for an adult too.&#8221; - Bella Dia&#147;I am always in search of children&#8217;s books that are slightly offbeat and unique. It keeps things interesting for the grownups and the kids...The illustrations in Octonauts are vibrant and detailed. They are the kind of illustrations that the kids stare at for a while, so they can find all the intricate story and character details that are not explained in the text.&#8221;- MamaLibrarian&#147;An important lesson is taught about not taking important things for granted. Are we taking important things for granted in our world such as our environment? Although the book appeals to young children, it has a wry sense of humour which will also appeal to adult readers. The illustrator is not afraid to be adventurous&#133;All in all, the book provides a feast for the eyes!... Meomi&#8217;s story will inspire discussion about issues as far ranging as underwater creatures, shadows, submarines, friendship, and traveling to different parts of the underwater world.

The characters have each a compelling personality and the story is a voyage in the realm of a very fertile imagination and the plot unfolds with page after page of visual goodness&#133;Mind you, if you're a serious illustrator, her books are a must have for study and reference.&#8221; - NetDiver--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The Octonauts &amp; the Sea of Shade.

This is a lovely, lively, anecdotal anthology of good stories about cycling for the millions more who have taken it up for sport, fun, health and wealth since the turn of the century.

With The Bicycle Book, Bathurst adds her voice to the call that we are now at the dawn of a new golden age of this versatile machine.'

The result--too many animals, not enough room. Just as Percy tries to sort out the tangled bedclothes, the animals panic upon hearing unearthly scratching from below the floor. Not to worry--it's only a mole, also seeking warmth, but during that intervening time each animal has discovered a cozy niche in Percy's messy quarters ideally suited to its needs. The illustrations are lighthearted and the penultimate scene of the cluttered room is a wealth of eye-catching details. Percy's bulletin board, with notes from Santa and an invitation from H. R. H. reveal Butterworth's whimsical sense of humor. While not breaking any new ground, this is an ingratiating if not exceptional wintertime selection. --Phyllis G.

The concept is clever and creative, and magic, treason, and Spanish grandees make for an entertaining read, yet the pacing-either bewilderingly fast or inert thanks to arch description-may throw readers off.

The Aberdeen, Scotland, police detective finds himself working two kidnapping cases that couldn&#x2019;t be more different. In the first, a mother-daughter singing duo, made famous on the TV show Britain&#x2019;s Next Big Star, is being held for ransom with the little girl&#x2019;s toes offered up as proof of their abductors&#x2019; seriousness. In the other, a junkie has gone missing, presumably due to her boyfriend&#x2019;s role in a drug deal. If Dark Blood (2011) suffered from slackness, then this installment finds MacBride roaring back to form. The crimes are breathtakingly awful, the pacing is breakneck, and the stakes are higher than ever. Indeed, when fallout from his actions lands close to home, McRae finds himself wracked by guilt far worse than his many physical wounds. Few writers can blend bantering humor with gut-wrenching violence without it feeling cheap. MacBride entertains while still offering food for thought about what we consume as entertainment: Why does the public weep for one missing mother, who may be a fame-hungry monster, while not caring about another, who may be a victim of circumstances? There&#x2019;s little comfort in this bleak ending, but still: brilliant. Bloody.

The situations are familiar: \"Out in the sandbox/you threw lots of sand./You ran from the slide,/after slapping my hand.\" Fans can follow the 10 dinosaurs by starting with their names and pictures on the endpapers. Expressions are expertly painted for humorous effect, including the defiant Tsintaosaurus letting water overflow onto the floor and the rollicking Pachycephalosaurus kicking the seat while mother is driving the car. The large, colorful spreads and rhyming text that is still a joy to listen to after repeated readings make this a successful storytime selection. Well-designed pictures and skillfully arranged words will entice newly independent readers, who will be challenged to find the dinosaur name hand-lettered in the illustration where the creature is introduced.

{"asin": "0007367880", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Eric Newby has never been bedeviled by practicality. Hence this  1,200-mile journey down the Ganges River, which the author undertook in  1963 in the company of his wife and an ever-changing crew of Indian  retainers. What moved him to take the trip? Partly it was the memory of  his military service in India more than two decades before. And as he  confesses, Newby has a lifelong and perhaps congenital love of rivers:  \"I like exploring them. I like the way in which they grow deeper and  wider and dirtier but always, however dirty they become, managing to  retain some of the beauty with which they were born.\" Few rivers grow  quite as dirty as the Ganges, which also goes by such nicknames asAtula(\"Peerless\"),Savitri(\"Stimulator\"), andBhinna-brahmanda-darpini(\"Taking pride in the broken egg of  Brahma\"). And few accounts of this mighty waterway could possibly be as  acute and hilarious asSlowly down the Ganges, which Newby first  published in 1966.As always, the author finds human comedy everywhere he looks. Take his  initial departure from beneath the Balawali Bridge, where a highly  emotional crowd has gathered to see him off:Two hundred yards below the bridge and some twelve hundred miles from  the Bay of Bengal the boat grounded in sixteen inches of water.... I  looked upstream to the bridge but all those who had been waving and  weeping had studiously turned their backs. The boatmen uttered  despairing cries for assistance but the men at the bridge bent to their  tasks with unwonted diligence. As far as they were concerned we had  passed out of their lives. We might never have existed.And so it goes, even as Newby and his crew run aground 63 times in the  first six days, or switch doggedly from boat to train to bullock cart  and back to boat again. His patience in the face of continuous disaster  is superbly entertaining, as are his attempts to mollify his  increasingly impatient wife, Wanda. Still, his gift for the farcical  slow burn never keeps him from relishing the terrain, or from recording  it in lyrical yet laconic prose: \"At about six the sky to the east  became faintly red; then it began to flame and the moon was  extinguished; clouds of unidentifiable birds flew high overhead; a  jackal skulked along the far shore and, knowing itself watched, went up  the bank and into the trees; mist rose from the wet grass on the  islands on which the shisham trees stood, wrapped like precious objects  in their bandages of dead grass.\"Slowly down the Gangesis  packed with such time-lapse portraiture, along with plenty of casual  wisdom about history, humanity, and (last but not least) conjugal life.  It's one of those rare voyages we only wish were much, much slower.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Slowly Down the Ganges", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 309313}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Jee3Jk6FL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007367759", "0864427654", "0684870193", "1590171659", "1857885953", "0142001007", "0864426054", "0864426275", "0375757538", "1590171667", "0141442077", "0449906140", "0812979656", "0002158663", "1582430152", "0618658947", "0007367910", "140003065X", "038533303X", "0679727140", "1616952687", "0007597835", "0345536258", "0143039725", "0143039644", "0312429967", "0007367929", "0007367872", "0812976533", "0007367511", "0812932528", "1597263869"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0002158663", "0142001007", "0007367759", "0864427654"]}},

{"asin": "0007344201", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Taking a break from his Logan McRae series, MacBride offers a stand-alone whose premise is pure, twisted genius. Ash Henderson, a big, bruising police detective in fictional Oldcastle, Scotland, has been chasing a killer who snatches girls before their thirteenth birthday, tortures them to death, and then sends birthday cards&#x2014;with gruesome photos&#x2014;to the girls&#x2019; families each year thereafter. The kicker? Henderson has been getting the birthday cards, too, but won&#x2019;t tell anyone his missing daughter is also a victim: if he&#x2019;s taken off the case, he&#x2019;ll lose his chance to catch the &#x201C;Birthday Boy&#x201D; himself. This has all the hallmarks of MacBride&#x2019;s best books&#x2014;gruesome violence, foul weather, pitch-black humor, and entertainingly mismatched protagonists (Henderson is paired with &#x201C;freak-show&#x201D; forensic psychologist Alice McDonald). But despite all this has to offer readers so inclined, MacBride needs an editor who&#x2019;s not afraid to use a knife, as the book feels about 100 pages and one plot twist too long. On the other hand, those who enjoy spending time in MacBride&#x2019;s dark world may not mind a bit. --Keir Graff", "title": "Birthdays for the Dead", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 422317}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XuXImjT1L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007344244", "0007362544", "0007419465", "0007344295", "B005IV0BHS", "0007344260", "0007419457", "0007342578", "0007419422", "0007560486", "0007419449", "0007344309", "0312940599", "0312949359", "B005EP2XSS", "0312382634", "0802122485", "1616148772", "0062004808", "0316224553", "0525954015", "1616147164", "1616147873", "0802122132", "0062219464", "0544319486", "0345533763", "0307960498", "0062240501", "0857382225", "0345807154", "034580709X", "0061986488", "0399162380", "031233995X", "0670026328", "1250036135", "0399162372", "0143123769", "0385351372", "1623650003", "1476744483", "031622460X", "0061990620", "1405913185", "1842999575", "0525952969", "0312359675", "0316188522", "1605985104", "1476724024", "0385348452", "1455517135", "0061990639", "0330546015", "1609450922", "0316224588", "0751545643", "0802122507", "0802121071", "0802145175", "0399165525", "B00969PYQ6", "0062271601", "1616950102", "0544319494", "0143119494", "0802146120", "0399166432", "0802122043", "1590200276", "0670026468", "0316188514", "0727883313", "0316069345", "0062227378", "0804170649", "0802126073", "0802145566", "0525954007", "0312643217", "0743289242", "0345547497", "0142196835", "0547792778", "0312384424", "0312614586", "0316069515", "0547738757", "0330518712", "0062237187", "000734421X", "1611090997", "006052524X", "1250007585", "039915972X", "161695230X", "1454901276", "0802121489", "1455504734"], "bought_together": ["0007344244", "0007362544"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007419457", "0007419449", "0007419465", "0312382634"]}},

But now he's traveling to Oden's Ford to earn an education in the magical arts, and it will not be without peril. Despite the fact that the academy is known as &#x201C;the great leveler,&#x201D; there are students who have reason to hate Han, specifically the Bayar twins, Micah and Fiona, because he stole the Demon King's amulet from their father, the High Wizard. To gain the upper hand on them, Han joins forces with a mysterious wizard he met in the dream world, but what this wizard asks in return may be more than the teen wishes to give. Meanwhile, Princess Raisa has fled from an arranged marriage with Micah Bayar. She and her loyal&#x2013;and beloved&#x2013;soldier, Amon, are also making their way to Oden's Ford so that Raisa might receive a military education in order to become a stronger ruler. Raisa's and Han's paths have crossed in the past, but when they meet again their connection is more powerful than before. Chima has created an intricate world with a rich history, cultural prejudices, and complicated political dynamics. Her characters are multifaceted: no one is either completely evil or insipidly perfect&#x2013;each has shortcomings as well as redeeming traits. Readers would do well to pick up the first book in this series before tackling this one, as there are some details that will be lost without knowledge of what transpired in The Demon King (Hyperion, 2009), but those who love a well-thought-out fantasy will enjoy this novel.Heather M.

Sisters Suki and Tess hail from an Irish town where the postmistress, Danae (a woman of mystery to curious townsfolk), is joined by her heartbroken niece, Mara&#x2014;romances ensue. Stories with four main characters are bound to be complex, and this one is no exception, but plots and subplots are well handled. Secondary characters are quirky and add to the reading fun. The omniscient narration covers 20 years in the lives of the women through flashbacks, artfully placed to shed a little light on present-day happenings and just enough information to ensure a suspenseful read. Kelly&#x2019;s readers will take comfort in her recognition of the humor in daily life, the necessity of friendship to women, and the strength of bonds among families. This modern-day fairy tale, which starts out sad and ends up just fine, will please Kelly&#x2019;s fans and appeal to more mature readers of chick lit. --Ellen Loughran--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.", "title": "House on Willow Street", "price": 10.38, "salesRank": {"Books": 1738736}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uPgI7Y%2BhL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007240449", "0747260583", "0385351852", "B006CDEK6E", "1853717967", "0007156332", "0143118498", "0452283388", "1451616767", "1416564608", "B001P5HD54", "B001PO69G4", "B001PO69GO", "0007466935", "1402260113", "0747260575", "0755343875", "0755333861", "1444706829", "0857208969", "0007488238", "0330520539", "1782921966", "0007373678", "0755378407", "B003E7EW1O", "184983203X", "B0058M5CLM", "0241950589", "0060731486", "0755378431", "B00CY3B8GQ", "1402284403", "1402218338", "0593071514", "000743734X", "0752847953", "1844880699", "1250046343", "0755332520", "075289336X", "0752883496", "184744458X", "0752883526", "1409135470", "1476704511", "0340766891", "1782921982", "1849164185"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007373678", "B005Q6ECLG", "B001PO69G4", "1476704511"]}},

{"asin": "0007388160", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Early one morning in February 2008, Oates drove her husband, Raymond Smith, to the Princeton Medical Center where he was admitted with pneumonia. There, he developed a virulent opportunistic infection and died just one week later. Suddenly and unexpectedly alone, Oates staggered through her days and nights trying desperately just to survive Smith's death and the terrifying loneliness that his death brought. In her typically probing fashion, Oates navigates her way through the choppy waters of widowhood, at first refusing to accept her new identity as a widow. She wonders if there is a perspective from which the widow's grief is sheer vanity, this pretense that one's loss is so very special that there has never been a loss quite like it. In the end, Oates finds meaning, much like many of Tolstoy's characters, in the small acts that make up and sustain ordinary life. When she finds an earring she thought she'd lost in a garbage can that raccoons have overturned, she reflects, \"If I have lost the meaning of my life, and the love of my life, I might still find small treasured things amid the spilled and pilfered trash.\" At times overly self-conscious, Oates nevertheless shines a bright light in every corner in her soul-searing memoir of widowhood.

{"asin": "0007419449", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. Relentless rain reflects the tormented mood that permeates MacBride's impressive debut set in Aberdeen, Scotland. Det. Sgt. Logan MacRae, back from a lengthy convalescence caused by a crazed suspect's knife attack, is plunged straightaway into the investigation of a brutally murdered child. To make matters worse, the victim's family learns of the death from a reporter before the police have a chance to inform them. Angered and embarrassed by the press leak, Logan, aided by WPC Jackie Watson, vows to expose the source within the precinct. Enter Colin Miller, flashy journalist, who befriends Logan, causing suspicious stares from Logan's superiors. More children go missing, and soon the populace of Aberdeen is screaming for blood. Further inciting the rabble, a notorious defense attorney earns acquittal for a habitual child molester. As a result, a hapless, ruined scholar&ndash;turned&ndash;street sweeper becomes a scapegoat for the chilling fear that grips the community. Logan must eliminate the distractions caused by the sensational publicity and summon his barely restored strength to anticipate the killer's next move. MacBride allows his characters their humanity, while weaving intriguing subplots in this edge-of-your-seat page-turner.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007367759", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "For more than a decade following the end of World War II, Eric Newby  toiled away in the British fashion industry, peddling some of the ugliest  clothes on the planet. (Regarding one wafer-thin model in her runway best, he  was reminded of \"those flagpoles they put up in the Mall when the Queen comes  home.\") Fortunately, Newby reached the end his haute-couture tether in 1956. At  that point, with the sort of sublime impulsiveness that's forbidden to fictional  characters but endemic to real ones, he decided to visit a remote corner of  Afghanistan, where no Englishman had planted his brogans for at least 50 years.  What's more, he recorded his adventure in a classic narrative,A Short Walk  in the Hindu Kush. The title, of course, is a fine example of Newby's  habitual self-effacement, since his journey--which included a near-ascent of the  19,800-foot Mir Samir--was anything but short. And his book seems to furnish a  missing link between the great Britannic wanderers of the Victorian era and such  contemporary jungle nuts asRedmond  O'Hanlon.At times it also brings to mindEvelyn Waugh, who  contributed the preface. Newby is a less acidulous writer, to be sure, and he  has little interest in launching the sort of heat-seeking satiric missiles that  were Waugh's specialty. Still,A Short Walk in the Hindu Kushis a  hilarious read. The author excels at the dispiriting snapshot, capturing, say,  the Afghan backwater of Fariman in two crisp sentences: \"A whole gale of wind  was blowing, tearing up the surface of the main street. Except for two policemen  holding hands and a dog whose hind legs were paralysed it was deserted.\" His  capsule history of Nuristan also gets in some sly digs at Britain's special  relationship with the violence-prone Abdur Rahman:Officially his subsidy had just been increased from 12,000 to 16,000 lakhs of  rupees. To the British he had fully justified their selection of him as Amir of  Afghanistan and, apart from the few foibles remarked by Lord Curzon, like  flaying people alive who displeased him, blowing them from the mouths of cannon,  or standing them up to the neck in pools of water on the summits of high  mountains and letting them freeze solid, he had done nothing to which exception  could be taken.Newby also surpasses Waugh--and indeed, most other travel writers--in another  important respect: he's miraculously free of solipsism. Even the keenest  literary voyagers tend to be, in the purest sense of the term, self-centered.  ButA Short Walk in the Hindu Kushincludes wonderfully oblique portraits  of the author's travel companion, Hugh Carless, and his wife, Wanda (who plays a  starring role in such subsequent chronicles asSlowly down the Ganges). There  are also dozens of brilliant cameo parts, and an indelible record of a stunning  landscape. The roof of the world is, in Newby's rendering, both an absolute  heaven and a low-oxygen hell. Yet the author never pretends to pit himself  against a malicious Nature--his mountains are, in Frost's memorable phrase, too  lofty and original to rage. Which is yet another reason to call this little  masterpiece a peak performance.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 327059}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81E52XRCwaL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0195325605", "0141442077", "0864427654", "0007367880", "0156031566", "0143039725", "0142437190", "0864426054", "0375757538", "1590171659", "0864426275", "158243171X", "1590171667", "0312622058", "0007597835", "0141442085", "0375727485", "081016065X", "0618658947", "1568360223", "0156027496", "1619491877", "1599218933", "0374514429", "0679727140", "0143039385", "1590177541", "0547255276", "1585427438", "0195030672", "0140094296", "1590172442", "0007367929", "159017187X", "0312278500", "0385291604", "0300163681", "0679737324", "0143105515", "0691154414", "0142437522", "1589880668", "0142001007", "0810160714", "1590171888", "1568361424", "0679762876", "0812932528", "0375724958", "0006544150", "0007367511", "1585747289", "159017674X", "1590173228", "1580084168", "1906011419", "0316923354", "0156032791", "1592287247", "1590206460", "0671400452", "0910395829", "0786714387", "039552105X", "0142401110", "1582432554", "0679722165", "067972902X", "1567923925", "0007367910", "1400033837", "1599210630", "0375755063", "1848853130", "0307958280", "0679776117", "019983265X", "0486203263", "0374126453", "0140255087", "0312421516", "0307948889", "0451530497", "0547237936", "061883933X", "037575640X", "0316358339", "0375725938", "0060505087", "1400031672", "1573226521", "1585679569", "0452259614", "0307474461", "0671695886", "1400078334", "0061231770", "0375714065", "0060596554", "0002158663"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0142437190", "0141442077", "0143105515", "0007367880"]}},

The author of such classics of travel literature as A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush and Slowly Down the Ganges takes the armchair traveler with him as he and his companion contend with misleading signposts, lonely roads, torrential rain, gale-force winds and unhelpful natives who describe any destination as \"up the road a bit\" although it may be circular miles away. As a result, the Newbys fall upon many culturally significant points by absolute chance. Trips to remote castles, holy wells and splendid ruins in the west of Ireland are enlivened by lashings of Guinness and tea, and by the often antic behavior of the locals met in omnipresent pubs. The Newbys, who live in England, returned to Ireland in the summer, when travelers are more expansively welcomed and more places are open, but it is their winter tour that captures the essence of the country and its delightfully idiosyncratic populace.

She also discovers a Nazi war medal with the diaries and asks a retired history teacher to examine it. Within days, the teacher is bludgeoned to death. Then Britta, Elsy&#x2019;s closest friend as a teenager, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s, is also murdered. Through the diaries, Erica intuits that the solution to the mystery is rooted in events that took place during WWII. Once again, L&#xE4;ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012) employs Swedish history and her setting, Fjallbacka, the postcard-pretty village where Falck grew up, to craft an engaging tale that spans three generations of Fjallbackians. The author goes deep into the lives of a very large cast of characters, and some crime lovers might balk at a 520-plus&#x2013;page novel that is almost half family saga.

{"asin": "0007398549", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gregory's sixth novel moves from her usual historical fiction (A Respectable Trade, etc.) to a contemporary tale that treats familiar, middle-class domestic ground with a horrific tilt. Every Sunday, Ruth and Patrick Cleary, a young English couple married just four years, visit Patrick's parents in Bath. Both Ruth and Patrick work in news production, but even in the common area of career the balance of attention tips heavily toward Patrick. Ruth feels like an outsider in the close-knit Cleary family, and Patrick and his parents are oblivious to her pain. Orphaned since childhood, Ruth has always yearned for love and a sense of belonging. In the first flush of passion, Patrick promised these; he even promised to help Ruth recover her lost childhood by traveling back to her childhood home in Boston. Snugly married and absorbed by his career, however, Patrick has lost track of his wife and his promises. When the cottage at the end of the lane from his parents' manor house comes up for sale, he sells the Bristol condo Ruth loves without a thought. Ruth soon becomes a poster-girl for co-dependence: she loses her job and unwillingly becomes pregnant. After her son is born, she sinks into depression, allowing her mother-in-law to take over completely. Finally, she is manipulated into a \"rest home\" where she becomes zonked on antidepressants. Hitting bottom, Ruth rallies, only to take control of her life in a joltingly twisted way. Gregory writes smoothly enough, but her insights into the dysfunctional family are only pedestrian, laying fallow ground for a surprise ending that neither horrifies nor enlightens.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Little House", "price": 71.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 837857}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61jt72szkuL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0006511775", "1416593144", "0007145896", "1416590889", "0743272544", "1416563717", "0743272528", "0006514650", "0743246071", "0006496423", "0743272536", "1442453451", "0743249305", "0743249291", "145162607X", "1451626088", "1442476885", "1451626096", "1451629559", "0743249313", "0544222881", "1416549145", "1442453443", "0743269268", "0743272498", "1439124671", "1402224680", "1476746303", "0743227441", "1442476877", "1402265581", "1476735484", "0778314316", "1402250924", "1451626118", "075153840X", "054422292X", "1442476915", "1451629540", "0544223403", "1439170657", "145162610X", "1442476907", "1451633246", "1435122623", "141655047X", "0451236807", "145165684X", "0671634623", "0778328791", "1402214316", "0671535323", "074327251X", "B0064X92RY", "1402219024", "B0058M7Z1C", "0751540269", "0451237897", "1451648626", "0345495349", "0345495365", "1402244495", "1416563709", "0751538116", "0758271387", "0062361007", "0671701517", "1482702371", "0345434870", "1556524048", "0345511891", "1439183163", "1402241372", "1476703558", "0345408772", "0060176636", "0061094331", "0312312911"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1451626088", "145162610X", "1451626118", "1416590889"]}},

As the book begins, Brienne of Tarth is looking for Lady Catelyn's daughters, Queen Cersei is losing her mind and Arya Stark is training with the Faceless Men of Braavos; all three wind up in cliffhangers that would do justice to any soap opera.

The three survivors--a beautiful WAC, a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash, and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food, little water, and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux ofLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances,Lost in Shangri-Ladeserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II.--Lynette MongAmazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides ReviewsLost in Shangri-LaHampton Sidesis the editor-at-large forOutsidemagazine and the author of the international bestsellerGhost Soldiers, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax filmThe Great Raid.Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&rsquo;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&mdash;not tales of the &ldquo;ripping good yarn&rdquo; variety. Yet remarkably, in his new bookLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he&rsquo;s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&rsquo;t really a war story&mdash;not in a strict military sense. It&rsquo;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&rsquo;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have &ldquo;crash-landed in a world that time didn&rsquo;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&rdquo; The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who&rsquo;ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They&rsquo;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &ldquo;removable skin&rdquo; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.What ensues in Zuckoff&rsquo;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become&mdash;in a guarded, tentative sort of way&mdash;friends.But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&rsquo;s land between warring Dani tribes&mdash;a no-man&rsquo;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&rsquo;s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.Yes, therearestill a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&rsquo;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal partsAlive,Cast Away, andThe Gods Must Be Crazy. It&rsquo;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves&mdash;and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "Lost in Shangri-La: Escape from a Hidden World", "price": 3.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 3848138}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Go8ePXsGL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062133403", "0062133438", "0451224957", "0451234103", "1400078458", "1565124081", "1602392366", "0812968360", "0316159352", "0425255735", "0471423513", "1594487278", "1402273371", "0553381903", "0891418458", "1599210630", "0307453286", "0375760989", "0425252868", "038549565X", "0609807161", "B0085RZFDC", "0141001828", "1933718749", "0618257322", "1400064163", "0062116150", "0307387941", "0545055768", "0393345416", "030740885X", "0671664271", "0688016200", "078670621X", "0804100039", "0812974492", "0440246040", "0307346617", "0143125478", "0553384503", "0553385127", "006123625X", "0062009303", "031624290X", "0062116169", "140006693X", "0307275906", "0316501115", "0760345910", "0062066404", "0553381482", "0760344078", "0760345597", "0061650714", "0812974611", "1599951509", "0061950726", "0061802557", "145167757X", "0767910745", "0767913736", "1423152883", "006093638X", "0143111973", "0307888002", "0307389049", "0062020897", "0380789035", "067002581X", "0425257835", "0375708278", "1451640226", "0743270754", "0812980549", "0891419063", "0375842209", "0345541332", "0307476413", "0062218298", "0385494785", "1565129849", "0062118854", "0316176494", "0142001619", "0061537969", "0767919416", "1451617534", "1416571779", "0871407868", "076034518X", "039334407X", "140009593X", "0451419243", "0061792268", "0670024783", "0451232852", "0312539568", "1250037751", "0767929713"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062133403", "0451224957", "0425255735", "1400064163"]}},

Ziegler is sympathetic, but does not mince words in reporting misdeeds. None yet can entirely supplant Frances Donaldson's standard King Edward VIII ( LJ 3/15/75), but Ziegler has the advantage of access to much recent research, and pulls it all together in an account that is judicious, informed, and above all highly readable. There have been so many Windsor books that librarians will look for reasons not to purchase another. This is not the one to reject. However, don't discard your biographies of the Duchess--she is, surprisingly, a secondary figure in this masterful study of the King and ex-King who gave up a throne for the woman he loved.

The historian&#x2019;s daughter asks for his help because she knows her father&#x2019;s death was not suicide. In Peru, anthropologist Jess Silverton uncovers a sealed tomb that appears to be built by the Moche, an ancient civilization that practiced gruesome sacrifice. The two worlds collide, and what is eventually uncovered connects to a string of murders in which the victims were beheaded. But are these murders really suicides?

These divisions are heavily tilted toward Western geography; Europe is explored in 24 pages, and the continental United States in ten&#x2014;the same number as the entire continent of Africa. Each country/region page features a political map showing major cities and bodies of water, surrounded by captioned color photos highlighting relevant landmarks and traditions. An appendix of \"country indicators\" features facts about the area, population, and a Human Development Index for each country, along with circular charts showing forest areas and other facts in a confusing visual format that tries to do too much at once.

{"asin": "0007522029", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* The German Swiss priest and theologian&#x2014;and most famous and prolific contemporary critic of the Roman Catholic Church&#x2014;portrays it as a gravely ill patient in need of radical therapy to recover and thrive. It is suffering from the Roman system, a centralized, hierarchical structure of authority, monarchical in character and imperial in action. Established in the eleventh century by means of a clutch of forgeries (e.g., the Donation of Constantine), that system is, K&#xFC;ng says, primarily responsible for the Orthodox-Roman schism, the Protestant reformation, and the antiscientific and antidemocratic bias in Christianity. Ever entrenching the power of the pope and the Vatican bureaucracy, especially after the 1870 declaration of papal infallibility and again after the second Vatican Council, the system continues to harm the church, driving out believers, lay and clerical, who question it, discouraging vocations to the priesthood, and thwarting ecumenism. K&#xFC;ng&#x2019;s prescription for restoring the church to health is many-faceted, but its effective ingredients derive from early Christianity; it is deeply reformist and revivalist, not revolutionary. Although the translation is idiomatically shaky here and there (e.g., ethician rather than ethicist), and K&#xFC;ng favors precision to scintillation, this updated revision of a 2011 German original is an invaluable summation of a great religious critic&#x2019;s life work. --Ray Olson", "title": "Can We Save the Catholic Church?", "price": 13.13, "salesRank": {"Books": 179326}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NIwM6QvXL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1441103163", "1472903730", "0465039952", "0809106094", "0812967623", "006202423X", "1626980691", "0829441700", "1601374585", "0804139148", "1616367571", "0826499104", "1497412498", "1616367016", "038519286X", "0802863590", "1626980063", "076482516X", "0802826598", "1626980292", "0809148676", "1626980667", "1616366575", "0814682642", "0809149087", "1594735425", "1592443451", "0814635504", "0061778184", "1570759537", "1558967117", "0615744052", "0826408486", "0809148269", "1468015648", "0814635687", "1933495642", "1934996092", "0814682529", "1476773955", "1570759081", "0310519594", "0062269976", "0809148773", "0062024353", "1472903706", "0826476988", "0826406785", "1626980810", "0826476902", "006227354X", "1626160198", "1118303598", "1593252625", "1611800528", "1626980411", "1627850171", "0814680585", "0826408842", "0812993462", "0770437354", "0824519973", "0670025305", "1557789061", "1626980772", "1612788009", "0670024872", "1616366443", "0829438920", "0143124390", "0966978323", "1922152609", "1441174621", "0199341079", "0824519256", "0814680666", "081468310X", "0814649513", "1626980489", "0824519507", "0061875708", "0802870724", "0674066979", "1586176927", "0679640924", "B00FEOQ96G", "0385135920", "1626980500", "1612787738", "067443000X", "1627850198", "1441150846", "0809147882", "1490372970", "1570757771", "0826408079", "0334026741", "1936260581", "0809148706", "1940598184"], "bought_together": ["1441103163", "0812967623"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0809106094", "1441103163", "0812967623", "0465039952"]}},

{"asin": "0007454767", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Sam Thompson's debut, a novel of stories set in enigmatic Communion Town, landed a coveted spot on the Man Booker longlist. Like David Mitchell and Italo Calvino, Thompson has some fun trying out literary styles. One chapter is written as a noir-ish caper, another as a futuristic romance, another follows a serial killer, and there's even a lovely childhood fable with notes of magical realism. The cumulative effect is of a world simultaneously revealed and obscured: just when you've gotten a grip on Communion Town, it's transformed. Thompson's sentences are graceful enough that he mostly pulls off these crafty fireworks&mdash;at least when it comes to miming a style. But too often, exhilarating sentences (like one describing the sea as full of the movements of an anticipatory audience, rustling programs, shushing itself...) are buried in descriptive layers that deaden an entire page. In the opening story, a dramatic event is obliquely mentioned over and over in the span of 20 pages. When the action is revealed, it hardly seems worth the wait. Thompson is a talented writer with a seemingly boundless interest in language and its potential; one can't help but wish that he applied some of his energy to getting to the point.

{"asin": "000761263X", "description": "Converts and skeptics alike will admire Young's balanced, accessible study of Eastern medical traditions. More comparative anthropology than health guide, it will be ideal for people interested in Eastern medicines but daunted by the information glut. Young (Acupressure Step by Step), who has extensive and intensive training (five years in Japan studying acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage, movement therapy and so on; advanced acupuncture and qi gong training in China; numerous visits to India to study Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine) advocates an informed selectivity (i.e., pick and choose from among these practices), which avoids blurring the traditions into the kind of exotic pan-Asian fantasy promoted by some Westerners. Each country is presented distinctly, as are their unique traditions. Concise historical contexts offer some fascinating tidbits. For example, after observing Indian doctors performing nose reconstructive surgery in the 18th century, British surgeons introduced the practice to Europe. By necessity, Young's far-ranging overview details only a few specifics, like Tibetan yoga, and mentions numerous others with refreshing and striking matter-of-factness. The layout is both artistic, featuring abundant reprints of Tibetan mandalas or sacred Japanese talismans, and instructive, with images of Japanese bathers in natural hot springs and photographs of stretching, massage and other techniques.

In this funky pop-up adaptation of the  classicHop on Pop, kids  do their best to perk up Pop after a bad day. The furry yellow Seuss-critters  know \"it's best not to HOP on POP,\" but \"we like to hop. / We like to hop / on  top of Pop. / STOP!\" Other, more human-looking children give their fathers  gifts, such as \"a set of Slim Jim Swim Fins\" (pink, three-toed marvels), violin  serenades, and for the man who has everything... \"a Bright Dwight Bird-Flight  Night-Sight Light.\" Clever paper engineering livens up this six-spread volume  (not that anything by Dr. Seuss ever needed enlivening). Young readers will love  making the gleeful characters hop on pop over and over, and will laugh to see  the walrus (another less-than-welcome gift) licking one poor daddy's ear.

In this lavishly illustrated book on Tibetan spiritual wisdom, Peacock, a British professor of Indian religions, answers these questions as he analyzes Tibetan approaches to life, death and rebirth. One unusual feature is the book's extended discussion of how Tibetan Buddhism has been informed by Bon, the pre-Buddhist folk religion that is still practiced by many in Tibet. From Bon, Tibetan Buddhism has appropriated \"preoccupation with shamanic healing, demonic forces, and the fight between good and evil,\" contributing to Tibet's complex and esoteric form of Buddhism. Peacock also describes how tied Tibetan religion is to the landscape of Tibet, \"the land of snows\"--a particularly important issue in the past 50 years, when Tibetan Buddhism has flourished in exile.

The latter half offers easy-to-prepare dishes with a healthy, vegetarian bent (while also delivering a tempting leg of lamb and a luscious chocolate pudding) that aim to increase energy, promote concentration and flush out toxins. Savona has a lot of dietary zeal: she gives instructions for a three-week \"cleansing program,\" and directs readers to avoid almost all sugars. But her tone is cheery and accepting; she says, for example, that while alcohol should generally be avoided (despite recent data suggesting a drink a day can be beneficial), a glass of wine can be \"good for the soul.\" Savona's diet advice, too, is eminently reasonable, favoring fresh fruits, vegetables and fish. Her best recipes recall her childhood in the Middle East, such as Shekshouka, a stew of tomatoes, peppers, and onions, and Khosaf, a fruit dessert. Seatown Kedgeree and Gobble Pie, two hash-like main courses, may be a tad on the British side, but they, too, are appealing, presented with confidence and flair.

{"asin": "0007828780", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Esteemed editor Bob Wyatt's initial book for his new imprint, this much ballyhooed first novel is not notable for literary merit but for the melodramatic story it tells. Set during the last two decades in Topeka, Kans., and centering on a tough kid named Tully who oddly resembles skater Tonya Harding in looks and deportment, the narrative chronicles Tully's wild struggle against her lower-class origins, circumstances and fate (not to mention her genes) without any redeeming growth or insights achieved by any of the central characters until at the end Tully belatedly realizes the error of her ways. It's an emotionally crude coming-of-age story in which Tully, her two best girlfriends and the two men she loves never seem to rise above adolescent emotions and behavior. The story has the no-holds-barred, cranked-out quality of 19th-century penny novels, with an abundance of cheap thrills and hair-raising scenes. We tag along as Tully endures abandonment, incest, abortion, child and spousal abuse, passion, promiscuity, marriage, motherhood, infidelity, terrible nightmares, midnight graveyard scenes, tortured partings with lovers and more. The most interesting character is the villain, Hedda Makker, Tully's mother, whose chief pleasure in life is beating the living daylights out of Tully. Though billed as \"a big Russian novel\" about mothers and daughters, much of the narrative has a breathless, awkward oral texture, although long patches of exposition have an evenness and clarity that suggest Simons's potential. Despite all the wailing, sighing and bloodletting--or perhaps because of it--the story is engrossing as tabloid features often are: not believeable or artful, but fascinating in a macabre way. 165,000 first printing; $150,000 ad/promo; BOMC selection .Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Tully", "price": 14.72, "salesRank": {"Books": 2046533}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61H4J2v7bwL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007118937", "0006550576", "0061988227", "0061987468", "006185414X", "0062098136", "1582882657", "0006551114", "0062103237", "0007241585", "0007241550", "042521558X", "0425227642", "0425234231", "0060199261", "0312180918", "1451655789", "1590131665", "014242059X", "0758278454", "0062313630", "0312967004", "0375832610", "0307279383"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061988227", "0061987468", "006185414X", "0062103237"]}},

{"asin": "0007491263", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* Sporting an enthusiastic introduction by George R. R. Martin (in which he calls the book &#x201C;the original game of thrones&#x201D;), this is the first U.S. publication of the first volume of French novelist Druon&#x2019;s seven-volume historical saga, collectively known as The Accursed Kings. Originally published in 1955, the novel is set in the year 1314. Philip IV, the king of France, has disbanded the Knights Templar, arresting, torturing, and executing most of them. Relations between France and England are as strained as they have ever been. Philip&#x2019;s increasingly desperate search for money to pay his massive debts has virtually bankrupted the country. Against this sprawling backdrop, Druon tells the story of Robert of Artois, a French lord whose lands have been taken from him by his greedy aunt and whose efforts to reclaim his birthright will lead to all-out war between France and England. Unlike Martin&#x2019;s multivolume Song of Fire and Ice, Druon&#x2019;s saga is based on real history and features real people as its central characters. It&#x2019;s historical fiction on a grand scale, full of political intrigue, family drama, and characters who, while drawn from life, are larger than it. Fans of historical epics who have not yet discovered Druon&#x2019;s saga will be thrilled with this one. --David Pitt", "title": "The Iron King (The Accursed Kings, Book 1)", "price": 1.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 17171}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kX4D-nWLL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["000749128X", "0007491298", "0007491328", "0312874561", "0007491344", "000749131X", "0007491336", "0007491352", "2253011010", "1477849106", "0399159223", "1477849297", "159102594X", "0345396731", "0812511816", "1402294069", "0345517563", "0345537262", "0765348780", "0804178321", "0857663836", "0553805444", "0345404335", "0062240323", "0316080683", "075153840X", "0756404746", "0061969672", "076533206X", "0060956852", "0345396685", "1590201191", "0525953094", "1590201183", "1402271085", "1400069491", "0312156960", "0765334771", "0007491271", "158567883X", "0061688541", "159020784X", "1591026415", "1591026903", "0765348799", "0553582011", "0679721827", "0061969702", "0061969710", "0752499491", "0061379743", "0553383086", "0886773849", "0751541362", "7119005901", "0374104093", "0345537998", "0765319233", "0143124927", "0385536038", "0765356155", "0062197754", "1590173465", "055357793X", "0062240331", "0452261120", "0385489498", "0312382456", "0451417550", "0062195549", "0804139024", "0441627404", "0312187149", "0394751043", "0140294295", "0691140898", "0743266110", "055358202X", "0765300354", "0547773749", "1402225180", "0802121608", "0547740107", "B00C8CQTJY", "0240808452", "1937408000", "0441104029", "0441172695", "0140170413", "1250037557", "1612182364", "0307743950", "1616148934", "1606904388", "0312382472", "0316198358", "1451651686", "0553385690", "0345539788", "0812995201"], "bought_together": ["000749128X", "0007491298"], "buy_after_viewing": ["000749128X", "0007491298", "0345535529", "0007491328"]}},

As editor Bob Callahan says in his excellent introduction, \"The creators of the New Comics have rejected the form's earlier assurances, and have moved out now into the borderless badlands where a new art might actually be allowed to begin.\"The anthology features works by more than 80 comic strip writers. There are the big names--Art Spiegelman (of Maus fame), Simpsons creator Matt Groening,Weirdomagazine founder Robert Crumb--as well as works from less well known artists such as Gilbert Hernandez, Marc Caro, and Lorenzo Mattoti. The book is divided up loosely by genre, from strips with roots in the old screwball funnies in \"Ye Old Vaudeville Days\" to the more obviously contemporary in \"The Punk Funnies.\"The New Comics are brilliantly funny and clever, often dark and surreal.

Aided by the Stills, who are medical writers, he examines recent research demonstrating the link between hormones and headaches, noting that there is much about the biochemical relationship that remains unclear. Explaining how hormones are produced and the roles they play in the transmission of pain, Diamond describes headaches by type: tension, vascular (migraine and cluster) and organically caused, e.g., by tumors. Following chapters discuss treatments for different types of headaches, including medications, dietary changes (chocolate is a big culprit), relaxation and biofeedback. According to Diamond, these strategies, either alone or in combination, can eliminate or reduce more than 90% of headaches.

In the first section the author reconsiders received truths, such as \"sear the meat to seal in the juices,\" and proceeds to demonstrate, in this case, that it just isn't so. He evolves a means for the home cook to sterilize egg yolks without ruining them for hollandaise or mayonnaise, and discusses the function of sugar in sherbet texture. Explaining the relevant chemistry in accessible terms, McGee appeals to those who savor nuances of method in problem-solving, but in spite of some witty touches and a tone much lightened by etymological and historical asides, his very perseverance can become wearisome. The second section addresses health problems associated with eating habits, including a lengthy and informative, though scarcely comforting, treatment of cholesterol's impact on the circulatory system. In the final, highly readable section, McGee offers a more subjective view of gastronomy in essays paying tribute to Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin and the continuing quest for a science of taste.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Curious Cook: More Kitchen Science and Lore", "price": 22.6, "salesRank": {"Books": 101633}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ydS-Cv7sL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1594202680", "0684800012", "0143122312", "0684843285", "1569767068", "0688102298", "1416571728", "0770433219", "0393329429", "160358286X", "194123500X", "1933615982", "0470009551", "0375702024", "1938073622", "0982761015", "0714865907", "0811876438", "1938073614", "0316118400", "0307717402", "1594204071", "1941235018", "160819020X", "0470508965", "1452101787", "0984493603", "0231133138", "0684181320", "B001U83TWW", "1938073479", "1408802449", "1938073460", "0689706677", "1579653510", "B002NQB63E", "0307336794", "160774273X", "0679755357", "B001U59MDA", "1400034477", "1439172528", "1580082688", "B00250U9BI", "1439190739", "0060585366", "0811851508", "0307599485", "1579129110", "1607745291", "1607741911", "0982761007", "B004H1MV5A", "160819874X", "0470194960", "0684832402", "1607743949"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0684800012", "1594202680", "1933615982", "0684843285"]}},

Our ancestors used logs and hand tools to build durable, dry, windproof, and protective dwellings; and they fashioned chairs, tables, branches, and bushes. In this day of power saws, lumberyards, and high prices, it's good to know that you can build in the same way.How to Build a Log CabinPart Oneprovides complete directions for building cabins of three sizes: one-room, one-room and lean-to, and three-room.

Following the usual discussions of materials and tools and of the basics of drawing are chapters filled with fresh ideas on learning this art. One chapter introduces brushwork as a part of composition, another takes the student from photographs to finished drawings. Most important are the drawing exercises, which take a fluid approach to a subject, varying light and point of view and shifting visual interest. Also to the book's credit is its use of 29 different illustrators to inspire the student, among them Seymour Chwast and David Levine. This book is ideal for those wanting a more sophisticated manual than traditional works like Frank J. Lohan's Pen & Ink Sketching, Step by Step (Contemporary Bks., 1983). Daniel J.

Keating's Lincoln S & L among many others, Mayer not only denounces enormous profits based on Federal Deposit Insurance but suggests that members of Congress, bank regulators, Wall Street investment bankers and top accounting and legal firms condoned the pyramiding of speculative, overvalued and even nonexistent assets--all in return for campaign contributions, huge fees and self-perpetuating commissions. Names are named and nuts and bolts revealed, but the book's greatest virtue at times becomes its only drawback: the numbingly detailed intricacies--and blatant knavery--of each case history is almost beyond comprehension.

He begins with the basics: knives, the difference between a simmer and boil, and, to start it all off, \"Good Cooking Is in Your Hands.\" Then there are columns on ingredients and techniques, followed by \"holiday specials.\" Each one includes a menu so even the novice could prepare a meal of stuffed pork chops and a classic ratatouille some ten pages into the book. Beard's wonderfully descriptive prose gives a sense of immediacy to the text, and his remarks remain as timely today as when they were written. An essential purchase.

A force in educational reforms, Adler appeals to the culturally fluent, frequently referring to classical and contemporary thinkers. The book's delights lie chiefly in his recollections of friends, among them Clifton Fadiman, Jacques Barzun and the late Robert Hutchins of the University of Chicago, with whom Adler compiled the Great Books of the Western World series from 1943 to 1952 (Adler unveiled a new edition in 1990, prompting canon-related controversy). Surprises include news of Adler's conversion to Christianity after decades of writing \"as a pagan for pagans.\" Now past 90, Adler chairs the board of editors of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica and directs the Institute for Philosophical Research, among other commitments. Furthermore, he plans to add to the 50 books he has written, and expects to publish these by 1995.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "A Second Look in the Rear-View Mirror: Further Autobiographical Reflections of a Philosopher at Large", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61JJulekv5L.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 14392765}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

For poets like Louise Bogan, Elinor Wylie, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Kay Boyle, modernism was a kind of male-dominated club to which women were seldom admitted. Harriet Monroe spearheaded opposition by women poets to an elitism that was shored up by academic schools of criticism culminating in the \"New Criticism.\" Drake's riveting literary history conveys new meaning on these themes by intimately linking women poets' artistic creativity to their marriages, loves, friendships, careers, aspirations. Anne Spencer's trailblazing as a black women poet and Babette Deutsch's political verse provide counterpoint to the personal stories of Amy Lowell, May Sarton, Sara Teasdale, Lola Ridge and others.

{"asin": "0020199856", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Literary detective Bruccoli has produced a remarkable feat of scholarship in this welcome critical edition of the novel Fitzgerald began during his final year (1940) while working in Hollywood as a screenwriter. Generally considered a roman a clef, the story charts the power struggle of self-made, overworked producer Monroe Stahr (modeled on MGM producer Irving Thalberg) with rival executive Pat Brady (a stand-in for MGM head Louis B. Mayer). It is also the story of Stahr's love affair with young widow Kathleen Moore and is (partly at least) narrated by Cecelia, Brady's cynical daughter who is hopelessly in love with Stahr. After Fitzgerald's death in December, his conflicting drafts for the novel were reworked by Edmund Wilson, who spliced episodes, moved around scenes and altered words and punctuation. Bruccoli, Fitzgerald biographer and editor of Cambridge's critical edition of The Great Gatsby , has restored Fitzgerald's original version and has also restored the narrative's ostensible working title, one that implies that Hollywood is the last American frontier where immigrants and their progeny remake themselves. Equally significant are other entries in this volume: Bruccoli's informative introduction; letters by Fitzgerald, Wilson and Maxwell Perkins; facsimiles of Fitzgerald's notes and drafts; and textual commentary, including helpful explanations of the novel's numerous topical references.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Love of the Last Tycoon", "price": 2.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 108004}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J09vyEcBL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["068480154X", "1557420580", "068480445X", "0486289990", "0811218201", "1557426805", "1499633157", "0811218228", "1492213470", "0989312070", "0679734228", "1570034559", "0684824485", "1570035296", "0817308849", "0684818981", "0521890470", "1591399688", "0684801531", "0684843781", "0374529949", "0684804522", "0743273567", "0684804425", "143919906X", "0062089390", "0143105493", "0747566011", "0684803356", "0684843323", "0743297334", "0486275469", "B00AEFYIDG", "1585671266", "0679781277", "1559363088", "143918271X", "0816670102", "1468304925", "0684801469", "0684837870", "0684825538", "0691101744", "1495355454", "0684830507", "0375704272", "0140249192", "1611453046", "0140481346", "0816679355", "0393925897", "0195173252", "0679732268", "0679728228", "0811219267", "0679732187", "0684822768", "0679731806", "052101073X", "0195087119", "0684803348", "1107605253", "1907360301", "0802138500", "1483990656", "1489559124", "0684830426", "0679447237", "0451530438", "0415063256", "0684169401", "0679748148", "0876857632", "0684842505", "0451523482", "0486434680", "0684865726", "014119409X", "0684801450", "0684839075", "0140481621", "1883011841", "1932800093", "1439198985", "045123992X", "0486282694", "0521897343", "0060183438", "0198742428", "0394758277", "0871402106", "0618056815", "0806114290", "0521624746", "0679736522", "0679732241", "0684826186", "B005KDO9WW", "0684801299", "0141180285"], "bought_together": ["068480154X", "1557420580"], "buy_after_viewing": ["068480154X", "1557420580", "0486289990", "0743273567"]}},

Now he owns the entire area, called the Soap Market, but has removed himself from the world and rarely ventures forth from his penthouse office. His trusted minion, Rook, himself a child of country parents, has grown devious and greedy, and demands bribes from the greengrocers; Victor sacks him when he discovers the man's treachery. Rook's desire for vengeance jeopardizes Victor's plan to \"share\" his millions by building a modern, glass-enclosed marketplace, which a pretentious Italian architect dubs Arcadia. Crace's theme here is the way cities corrupt men who grow sophisticated and wealthy. Arcadia--\"a rustic paradise\"-- can never be re-created in an urban setting; progress sweeps away the enriching past and puts people at a remove from the natural world. Crace does not falsely sentimentalize his country characters, however; they are merely less shrewd than their arrogant urban counterparts. His prose is energetic and sensuous, teeming with apt and stunning imagery. The narrative does not falter until its final pages, when its unalloyed mordancy begins to seem overdone. But this is a small flaw in an otherwise brilliant work. Major ad/promo.

This is wonderful news for all who love food and food writing. Erudite yet intimate,Delights and Prejudicesis, first, the memoir-with-recipes of a great American gastronome. It's also fascinatingly panoramic on good meals taken worldwide; on ingredients as diverse as the potato and the truffle; on great food places, markets to restaurants; and on food people, from Beard's cantankerous, food-muse mother to many of the stars of the last century's food firmament, including Julia Child. This is not only Beard's greatest work but also one of the best books we have on food and what we know about it.Beard's gastronomic life began in bounteous early-20th century Portland, Oregon, where his mother cooked for several hotels. An early culinary memory has the near-infant Beard relishing an onion, skin and all. From there the story captures a world of gastronomic likes and dislikes from \"sensational\" veal roasts to the gherkins known as cornichons, \"one of the mistakes the French make in eating.\" Beard's love of French food is, however, usually unmitigated, matched only by his adoration of traditional, locally produced American cooking. Recipes for this fare, including clam souffl&eacute; and candied-ginger pumpkin pie, are among the 150 formulas offered, a Beardian cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me that also encompasses hors d'oeuvres, breads, and cakes. The book also chronicles Beard's ascent to fame, beginning with his 1940s appearance onI Love to Eat, TV's first cooking show, to the arrival of his many influential cookbooks. It ends, characteristically, in his kitchen, \"the place where [he] can best satisfy the eccentricities of [his] own palate.\" The journey makes am enthralling read.--Arthur Boehm--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Delights and Prejudices", "price": 19.76, "salesRank": {"Books": 778019}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T2KJ1ZT5L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1596914467", "0679755047", "B0007FXENS", "0060167637", "0307718344", "0394484932", "031609868X", "0394522915", "0025080709", "051768800X", "0688076378", "0764542613", "0375759921", "0618444114", "1596914971", "086547236X", "0812971558", "076240664X", "076792889X", "1566493250", "0684800012", "0803220979", "0375756647", "0312642180", "1845203267", "0760702802", "0897331346", "0762406135", "B008W3SDJC", "1883642043", "014311767X", "0812980883", "1400069629", "0316085006", "0738217166", "B006G88R3W", "0544242203"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0760702802", "1596914467", "031609868X", "0385342616"]}},

The major portion of the book is oral history by and about track figures, including Richard Petty, \"The King,\" who won 200 races in his career, car-builder Ralph Moody, engine-builder Waddell Wilson, crew chief Andy Petree, unsponsored independent Dave Marcis (most drivers now have corporate bankrollers) and the current ruler of the raceways, Dale Earnhardt.

This 42-year-old Englishman's second work continues in the imaginative and almost poetic vein of his Continent ( LJ 3/1/87). Once again he creates a world, in this case a Stone Age village, seemingly distant from our own and yet so like it as to be almost frightening. It is a world confronting change brought on by the advent of bronze, a technological development not unlike the coming of the computer. The villagers, once secure and flourishing, suddenly find their craft--and themselves--obsolete. As the fabulist tale unwinds, Crace looks into the role of the artist in society--here, a storyteller--considering both the impact and limits of imagination in guiding us toward new horizons.

Gutman was among the first Western journalists to visit the \"death camps\" where Serbs tortured, raped, and slaughtered their prisoners--an act of deliberate policy, as the reports make clear. Gutman's reporting has won numerous awards, including the Pulitizer Prize and the George Polk Award, and this volume of his original dispatches from Newsday shows why. To some extent, there is nothing \"new\" here, but there is immense value in having these reports gathered together. What is the effect? Guilt. Shame. A sense that these events are truly reminiscent of the Nazi era--and the cowardice of the Neville Chamberlain period.

As he tells it, he achieved a lucky balance in his metamorphosis from self-centered, messianic student organizer to liberal Democrat now \"married to a real Hollywood star Jane Fonda: a beautiful, intelligent, infinitely creative human.\" His windy recitation touches the high points of a well-publicized careerleadership of Students for a Democratic Society, community organizing in Newark, Vietnam War protests, the Columbia University student riots, the Chicago Eight conspiracy trial in 1969, his trip with Fonda to Hanoi. While Hayden notes that he was overly romantic about the Vietnamese revolution, he charges that the U.S. government bears responsibility for continuing to besiege and bleed Vietnam.

Graham ( The End of Beauty ) salutes work that is singularly American in its \"signature ambition\": \"both to happen fast and have the experience .\"xxxii And the collection bears out her contention that the poems, culled from three dozen magazines, sport distinctive voices, yet not at the expense of imagery or form. Forms are wonderfully diverse, ranging from a classical debate in Anthony Hecht's \"Eclogue of the Shepherd and the Townie\"70 to Donald Hall's bitter lamentation, \"Praise for Death,\"53 and Anne Carson's abstract but evocative \"The Life of Towns.\"13 Moods swing from comic despair to mockery to elegy; something for every reader is here. Still, despite Graham's assertion that \"precision remained the watershed criterion,\"xxxi it is likely that only devotees of Language Poets--those dismantlers of conventionally articulate speech--will fully appreciate the fruit that lies beneath the undeniable difficulty of some prose poetry and poetic experiments.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Best American Poetry 1990", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Br7P%2BMBbL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005DIAD8I", "0020441827", "0684860031", "0684189836", "0020441819", "1439181497", "0020698445", "0684190958", "0020698453", "B005M4Z9QO", "1451658885", "0684847795", "0684193116", "0020698461", "0743299779", "0743203844", "0684801515", "068481451X", "B007PM4ZQQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 1571720}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

{"asin": "0020302800", "description": "Emphasizing the importance of planning ahead, this manual addresses the practical matters that death raises. It is divided into three parts: before, during, and after a death. Part I describes wills, living wills, and planning for disposition and commemoration. Part II deals with imminent death, covering the definition of death, uses of life support systems, hospice programs, and death care. Part III is for survivors, detailing how to make arrangements for disposition and funerals, how to administer an estate, and how to find help in grief and bereavement. The book on its own is an excellent guide for preparing for the inevitable. The detailed resource listings that follow each chapter make it a truly outstanding reference: annotated bibliographies, organizations, and agencies offering assistance are included. An appendix lists additional resources for finding help facing death.

As a Fellow of the Kellogg Foundation, Flanigan conducted a pioneering study of forgiveness, and from that study, from her clinical practice, and from her many years of teaching, researching, and conducting professional workshops and seminars, she devised a unique six-stage program, presented here.

{"asin": "0020359551", "description": "In this sequel to Towards the Mountain , South African writer Paton describes the Sharpeville massacre of 1960 in which 69 protesters were killed, many shot in the back. But Paton, who died last April, concludes that H. F. Verwoerd, architect of apartheid, was not an evil man, merely arrogant and self-deluded. This straightforward memoir by the author of Cry, the Beloved Country starts in 1948 with the Afrikan Nationalist Party's seizure of power. Chronicling government harassment, torture and the passage of racial laws, Paton follows the Nationalists' tightening death-grip on a country \"living on the slopes of a volcano.\" He writes in detail about the Liberal Party, of which he was founder and leader, defending it against critics who charge that it weakened the true opposition. Paton's testimony at the 1964 trial of Nelson Mandela, and his account of the Treason Trial (1956-61) in which hundreds of dissenters were arrested, are high points in this reenactment of his public life.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Journey Continued: An Autobiography", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Ad%2Bjk-lL._SL500_.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 3459837}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Wolfe was not a short story writer; most of these fragments were plucked from his massive manuscripts, and many would be more appropriately classified as essay or memoir. \"The Spanish Letter,\" relating the author's visits to Nazi Germany, strongly condemns the \"poisoning\" of German culture and society by Hitler and his followers. It's a fine piece, but elsewhere Wolfe's well-known faults are conspicuously displayed. Even one of the best known of these stories, \"Only the Dead Know Brooklyn,\" now embarrasses with its inept attempt to reproduce a Brooklyn accent. The puerile \"Portrait of a Literary Critic\" and heavy-handed \"Justice Is Blind\" are equally disappointing.

Windell stresses the need for patience, empathy and, above all, diagnosis. He asks parents to look at the nature of their discipline problems, their own expectations (reasonable or not?), the personality of the child involved, the results they hope for from any disciplinary move. He outlines the depressingly familiar naggings, screechings and whinings most parents resort to at some stage, and tries to offer alternatives. For instance, role playing can teach children to empathize with others; a contract between parent and child can set guidelines for mode of dress or other areas of conflict. Windell crisply illustrates his points with anecdotes--some of which sound too good to be true--and usefully sums up his positions at the end of each chapter. Much of the book is plain commonsense, but in an area so fraught with anguish, that commodity is not always easily come by, and as a quick reference to the best disciplinary moves in most situations, the book is helpful and well organized.Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Discipline: A Sourcebook of Fifty Failsafe Techniques for Parents", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21YDQXDSV6L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0028604156"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 2692334}, "categories": [["Books"]]},

Few conflicts illustrate this more clearly than the American Civil War. Macdonald, author of two earlier works with similar formats ( Great Battlefields of the World and Great Battles of World War II, both just released in paperback) has selected 17 crucial Civil War engagements and applied computer mapping to their geography. The field is presented in three-dimensional, computer-generated landscape models. Principal troop movements are marked to show the effects of ground on the action. The cartography is accompanied by an intelligent text, clear graphs of force and loss ratios, and well-chosen illustrations.

{"asin": "0020303955", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This volume comprises more than 100 creative variations on basic risotto, a rice dish from northern Italy. In addition to serving risotto as a first course in the Italian style, the authors suggest it as a side dish or as an entree when accompanied by bread and a salad or vegetable. These recipes derive from classic and new Italian cooking, as well as the authors' imaginations. Beginning with basic saffron risotto, Barrett and Wasserman work their way through cheese, vegetable, meat, fish, wine and even fruit-flavored dishes. Rice is combined with goat cheese, Gruyere, Camembert and ricotta, as well as with cabbage, zucchini blossoms or fresh mushrooms, cognac and cream. Seafood offerings include scallops, shrimp and mushrooms, squid and artichokes, and smoked salmon, while meat variations feature sweetbreads, duck and spicy rabbit. Strawberries, apples and grapefruits flavor some of the stylish, savory fruit risottos. Barrett is a freelance food writer, and Wasserman is an illustrator and owner of a gourmet-food shop.

The caller, Zeke, confesses to the murder of a young woman named Nina Klemmer. Andy immediately calls the police, who shrug it off as a gag or a crank call. But Andy persists when he happens to meet Nina, who is just as Zeke described her. She takes his warnings as harassment, however, and everyone now thinks that Andy himself made up the call. His attempts to ferret out Zeke and protect Nina, while compromising his own safety, make for an exciting tale of the terror lurking beneath everyday surroundings and behind ordinary events.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Wolf Rider", "price": 7.19, "salesRank": {"Books": 2579622}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z86ZCZ5EL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0152164278", "0142405736", "0805096752", "0553494104", "068985336X", "0152057803", "0786816015", "0689867158", "0374480656", "038574238X", "0142405965", "1416948821", "0061742678", "1423105168", "0307945022", "0439903548", "0060935472", "0545477115"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1416971084", "0152164278", "1423105184", "068985336X"]}},

Starting with this ball-and-cup contraption, the author of Fearful Symmetry uses gravity as a springboard to discuss phenomena ranging from the emergence of galaxies to the curvature of space-time, evidence for the existence of gravity waves and the shape of the universe in the first nanoseconds of creation and now. Zee is an extraordinary writer: playful, inspired, brilliant. Making complex ideas accessible without oversimplifying, his narrative proceeds elegantly by way of a series of enigmas that take the reader to the outermost edge of modern physics. He concludes with a look at the quest for \"dark matter\"mysterious, invisible stuff said to pervade the universeand the efforts of superstring theorists to unify gravity with other fundamental forces in a nine-dimensional cosmos.

{"asin": "0020363702", "description": "Based on reviews in Trouser Press , which regularly covered such groups as the Sex Pistols, Clash, Ramones, Television, and Blondie, the first edition of this book ( LJ 9/15/83) assessed 1000 of the most significant recordings of New Wave music. Evident in this new edition is how New Wave has been cross-fertilized by reggae, rap, hardcore, and other nonmainstream styles. The third edition reviews 3000 albums of innovative, political, witty, and often offensive music--music like that of the group Polkacide, described as \"accordians, horns, yelps, and general lunacy.\" The reviews are refreshingly blunt and insightful, without claiming more for the music than it merits, and the simple alphabetical arrangement and cross-referencing works well. The one drawback is that the book no longer includes both the U.S. and U.K. labels when both exist, but it may list a U.S. label with a U.K. release date.

{"asin": "0020427859", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 5-7-The charming beginning to Susan Cooper's series of five books, which comprise The Dark Is Rising, belie a series of sinister adventures. The Drew children Simon, Jane, and Barney find an old map in a hidden room while summering at the Grey House in Cornwall. Along with their Great-Uncle Merry, they become embroiled in a web of intrigue that surrounds an Arthurian legend. True to the original story (Harcourt, 1965), this audio version adds a dynamic vocal element from narrator, Alex Jennings. In the beginning the story seems a bit slow and tedious as the plot and setting are given their due, and the voices may be difficult to distinguish. After the first side of tape 1, they become more well defined. Jennings gives each child a distinct voice, yet keeps each connected to one another. Barney has the youthful vulnerability of the youngest sibling, Jane, the sensible and soft-spoken middle child, and Simon speaks with the assurance and bravado of the \"older\" brother. The rising tension created between the fight of good and evil gives strength and vitality to each character's voice. Listeners understand Mr. Hasting's loathing and fear of Great-Uncle Merry when hearing the deep tone and resonance of every utterance. Jennings' ability is outstanding as he slips in and out of the numerous voices with the rapid dialogue as it approaches the climax. His training and experience as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre give this story a vitality. This is an outstanding reading of a classic tale that all young listeners and adults will thoroughly enjoy.Tina Hudak, St. Bernard's School, Riverdale, MDCopyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Over Sea, Under Stone", "price": 5.98, "salesRank": {"Books": 2278887}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5117937X44L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0689829833", "1416949682", "0689840349", "1416949666", "1416949674", "0689829841", "0140440925", "0140441700", "0486287475", "0199537348", "0689710879", "0547773749", "0689710682", "0307946177"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1442489677", "0689829833", "0312367546", "1416949666"]}},

{"asin": "0020449313", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Fighting off a pack of starving wolves, wrestling alligators in the  swamp, romping with bear cubs, drawing off the venom of a giant rattlesnake bite with the heart of a fresh-killed deer--it's all in a day's work for the Baxter family of the Florida scrublands. But young Jody Baxter is not content with these electrifying escapades, or even with the cozy comfort of home with Pa and Ma. He wants a pet, a friend with whom he can share his quiet cogitations and his corn pone. Jody gets his pet, a frisky fawn he calls Flag, but that's not all. With Flag comes a year of life lessons, frolicking times, and achingly hard decisions. This powerful book is as compelling now as when it was written over 60 years ago. Read simply as a naturalist study of the Florida interior, it fascinates and entices. Add the heart-stopping adventure and heart-wrenching human elements, and this is a classic well worth its Pulitzer Prize. Earthy dialect and homespun wisdom season the story, giving it a unique and unforgettable flavor, and N.C. Wyeth's warm, soft illustrations capture an era of rough subsistence and sweet survival.

{"asin": "0020381026", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The Art of Russian Cuisineis almost as immense as the vast expanses of Mother Russia. Filled with 500 recipes for classic Russian dishes, it also provides a history of Russian food and culinary life. Anne Volokh, a Russian food writer who eventually emigrated to the U.S., enlivens her work by including passages from Russian literature and historical works. She concentrates on authentic cooking, often drawing recipes fromA Gift to Young Housewiveswritten by Ellena Molokhovets in the 1870s. The result brings to life how Russians ate when their rivers ran thick with fish and aristocrats had French chefs invent elaborate dishes like Veal Orloff, made with two creamy sauces.Naturally, Volokh starts withzakuski, the antipasto-like ceremony that can constitute a meal in itself; including herring, caviar, salads, even suckling pig in aspic. For soups, there are peasant-hearty borschts--which are actually Ukrainian, not Russian--and spicy Selianka, an example of upper-class cooking. In Russia, each soup has a proper garnish or accompaniment; Volokh provides them all, from sliced eggs in cold borscht to yeasty garlic rolls with the hot kind. Dishes such as Beef Stroganoff, Stuffed Cabbage, proper Bliny and Pashka (the sweetened cheese dessert), require culinary expertise, great patience, or both to make. But dishes such as Roasted Chicken with Raisin-Studded Stuffing and Baked Trout with Walnut-Based Satsivi Sauce are simple but rich.If Russian food interests you,The Art of Russian Cuisineis worth having for its traditional recipes and the enlightening exploration of their origins.--Dana Jacobi", "title": "The Art of Russian Cuisine", "price": 18.38, "salesRank": {"Books": 122854}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61H80AZF39L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0894807536", "1940585031", "1903141575", "0307886816", "0971601305", "0253212103", "383314081X", "0822936461", "039951032X", "160358286X", "1590201167", "0781801311", "0486273296", "0393050696", "0985516003"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0894807536", "0307886816", "1903141575", "1590201167"]}},

Menzies's organizational and proprietary efforts on behalf of the Ultra Project, by which German codes were broken and monitored, are covered in detail. The author reveals how \"C\" 's guardianship of the Ultra secret became his most important task during the war. In the end he became a prisoner of the secret, as Brown puts it, for he could not reveal it even in his own defense. Thus Menzies refrained from justifying his appointment of Kim Philby, the Soviet penetration agent, to the post of counterespionage chief. Brown examines the \"inexplicable decisions\" made by Menzies in regard to Philby, which included assigning him as liaison officer to the CIA and FBI during the Cold War, a position in which he had more access to secret military and policy information than any foreigner in Washington.

But when TV stations all over the world begin to broadcast the Trippy Show, the fanscalled Trippiesare hypnotized and flock to Trippy communes. By the time the second Tripod invasion begins, the Trippies greet the aliens as saviors and eagerly don the brainwashing caps provided them. Realizing that they can no longer stay in England and remain uncapped, Laurie and his family journey to Switzerland. When Switzerland falls under the Tripods' spell, Laurie, accompanied by two other boys, flees with his family to a remote spot in the Alps. The small band resolves to devote their lives to fighting the Tripods and thus form the core of the resistance movement that figures in the author's Tripods trilogy.

{"asin": "0020389655", "description": "Thomas Yannios is a doctor who's spent too many hours hovering at the bedsides of critically ill patients who suffer from a lifetime of poor eating habits. Yannios says most of the foods available on your supermarket shelves are bad for you, with more fat than is safe, or too much sodium, and only 15% have even minimally adequate sources of fiber. Yet, says Yannios, it's not so difficult to eat well if you know which items to buy and which to avoid like the plague. Ergo hisFood Report Cardbook, crammed with easily understandable ratings for 12,000 common foods, including brand-name products.Each food item is identified by food type (tomato sauce, for example), processing category (canned, bottled or refrigerated), brand (Progresso, for instance), any relevant descriptions, calories per serving size (27 per half cup, in the case of Progresso Tomato Sauce), and a nutrition grade of A, B, C, or D for a quick health judgment (the Progresso sauce receives an A-). Maybe you won't lug the book with you to the supermarket, but it doesn't take long to check out and compare the brands you usually consider. Do you buy frozen pizzas? Celentano's Cheese pizza rates a B-, compared to the Celentano Thick Crust Cheese, which scores a C-; the Weight Watchers 3 Cheese, not surprisingly, earns the highest mark (B+) and almost all the Tombstone pizzas scrape the bottom of the health barrel, with D-. Sometimes, even within one brand, the ratings can vary dramatically. For salad dressings, for example, Hidden Valley Ranch Honey Dijon weighs in with an A-, while the same brand's Original Ranch ranks a D-.Sure, you could probably figure this all out for yourself if you spent a few hours carefully comparing the nutritional chart small print, but do you? If you haven't got tons of time to invest in healthy cooking but are still interested in increasing the nutritional content while decreasing the junk quotient of what you ingest, Yannios's food-rating charts provide a fast and easy way to up the quality of your food, and ultimately, your health.--Stephanie Gold", "title": "The Food Report Card: 12,000 Favorite Foods Including Brand-Name Products, Graded A,B,C, or d Fornutritional Value", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71XGT5Y63NL.gif", "salesRank": {"Books": 3705289}, "categories": [["Books"]]},
